The party that always chooses whoever gets backed by the military industrial complex despite constantly preaching that we’re the “anti-war” party.

The party that claims the “diversity” party despite propping up the worst possible female candidates they could find to make the rich old dudes seem more relatable.

The party that still won’t shut the fuck up about Kamala Harris despite being out of the race for months and being the most useless sack of shit that can’t debate to save her own life.

The party that allows Mike Fucking Bloomberg a chance to speak about safety and privacy policy despite being the most authoritarian one in the entire race.

The party that talks down and belittles any and all underneath them even if you agree with them with the media. To them if you’re a democrat in their eyes you’re a weak little sheep that has to coddled and told what to think and how to act, if you’re not you’re a mindless slave to the trump administration or a nazi.

That party that eats away at its own party members for stepping out of line. Andrew Yang, Tulsi Gabbard, and Bernie Sanders are prime examples of this. They’d rather get destroyed by Trump by choosing Biden’s old jittering ass, than put up a fight with either of these three. Yang can’t win because he’s just too down to earth and believes in worker’s well-being. Tulsi can’t win because she actually wants out of the Middle East because she served there and cares way too much for Veterans. Sanders can’t win because he wants to expand health care among the middle and lower class. 

Oh but Biden isn’t Trump so he’s perfect! Sure his brain has to work overtime in order to comprehend more than a few sentences at a time and he’s basically just a show pony for the Obama years, but c’mon guys he isn’t the orange guy and that’s all we need!

Oh sweet jumping Jesus, the DNC. Never in my life have I seen a more corrupt, shit slinging organization in my life. The amount of times the DNC has been caught pushing favoritism or stealing votes from one candidate to another is on the level of dystopian nightmare, 1984 type of shit.

I am a member of a third party(Libertarian) and am sick of the dems and reps throwing the ball back and forth to systematically divide the country while they profit. a two-party system thrives off division. and ""the stakes"" get higher every election... George Washington said that political parties would destroy the country. Abraham Lincon said a house divided amongst itself cannot stand.

throw your hate. refuse to believe you can be wrong on anything. see where it leads. democracy is not perfect. but it is better than authoritarianism. it is better than a dictatorship. and it is better than a societal collapse. when we as a people are unwilling to compromise or admit to being wrong we risk the very heart of the nation. you see people lash out and try to kill government officials both Democrats and Republicans alike. you see people claim that someone who doesn't agree with them on everything as a false citizen. this type of attitude can, has, or will lead to the end of nations large and small. the united states is no different.

I didn’t really grow up practicing Judaism. I always felt like antisemitism wasn’t really a thing that would ever affect me.

""I don't see the glaring evidence that says we need to move forward. I didn't see it in the Trump case, and voted against it, I don't see it in this case.""
* Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) told Axios: ""I don't know that there have been any high crimes or misdemeanors alleged. If there are, that would be a matter to consider, but until something like that is alleged, I don't know what the purpose of that inquiry might be.""
* ""If we start converting impeachments into no-confidence votes and we don't do the homework ... then I'm not going to take it seriously,"" said Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), another leadership member.

Even Tuberville thinks it's bullshit LOL.  TUBERVILLE!

Sorry trolls, but your little impeachment fantasy ain't gonna happen.  The GOP knows it's political suicide and would lose them everything in 2024.

We are now living in 1930s NAZI Germany where having the wrong political views got people sent to Dachau concentration camp.

Details here:

Dachau  was one of the first\[a\] concentration camps built by Nazi Germany and  the longest running one, opening on 22 March 1933. The camp was  initially intended to intern Hitler's political opponents which  consisted of: communists, social democrats, and other dissidents. It is  located on the grounds of an abandoned munitions factory northeast of  the medieval town of Dachau, about 16 km (10 mi) northwest of Munich in  the state of Bavaria, in southern Germany. After its opening by Heinrich  Himmler, its purpose was enlarged to include forced labor,and,  eventually, the imprisonment of Jews, Romani, German and Austrian  criminals, and, finally, foreign nationals from countries that Germany  occupied or invaded. The Dachau camp system grew to include nearly 100  sub-camps, which were mostly work camps or Arbeitskommandos, and were  located throughout southern Germany and Austria.

With the election going on I figured I would try and get a perspective from the other side. I would like to say that the vast majority of you all seem like great people. I know that Reddit leans so far left that it might fall off the edge of the internet eventually, so I understand how being republican/conservative on this app can be frustrating. I actually agree with a lot of the points and arguments you guys make, I do disagree with some, but not nearly as many as I thought I would. I just think that it's the far extremists on both sides that are making everything seem so damn polarized right now. In reality, I bet 95% of us want similar things, but the media makes it seem as though we are polar opposites. I'm not sure about you all but I am tired of all of this. I am tired of the hate from the extremists on both ends, I'm tired of the politics smothering social media platforms, I am tired of this awful tension in the air all the time, and I am tired of being told that other Americans are my ""enemy"". I want to feel united as a country, not divided. After reading a ton of posts here over the past two days it seems like a lot of you all feel the same.

&#x200B;

Edit 1: I would like to say that the overwhelmingly large amount of positivity in the comments is great to see. Also, I know it's not a lot of upvotes so far but it's the most I've ever received on Reddit so thank you all so much.

&#x200B;

Edit 2: Thank you all for the awards, I feel like I need to prepare a speech or something. But as I mentioned before, all the messages and comments that I have seen so far have been nothing but overwhelmingly positive. It gives me a lot of hope for the future.

j4m2st,g5w7n,2020-10-03 13:24:14+00,The case for Donald J. Trump: A comprehensive guide to why we should re-elect him and reject the Democratic party.,"So for the first time in my life I voted early. Primarily so I don't need to take time off on election day, but also because this is the most consequential election since 1860.

I know that gets thrown around a lot. But it's seemingly true in every way.

To anyone on the fence about Trump, anyone thinking about sitting this one out, any liberal lurkers here looking for a different point of view. Here's why I voted for Donald J. Trump and you should too.

Washington has failed everyday Americans for decades. The establishment cares only about the interest of lobbyists. Most politicians see a significant increase in net worth after becoming a politician. It's often thrown around that Trump became President to serve his own financial interests. [But Donald Trump has lost over 30% of his net worth since becoming President, more than $1 billion.](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/trump-has-lost-1-billion-personal-wealth-running-president-n916221) Trump is a billionaire, he's an old man, he could have retired in peace and luxury, but he didn't. He took on the most stressful job in the world, and sacrificed immensely to do so. If that doesn't say something about his character, I don't know what does.

They say he's a warmonger, but he is the first President since Jimmy Carter (1977-1981) to not get America involved in a new armed conflict. He has drawn down troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. He has averted conflicts with Venezuela and Iran. He has helped negotiate peace deals between North and South Korea, Serbia and Kosovo, and Israel and several Arab states, earning him three nominations for the Nobel Peace Prize. [Due to his domestic policies, the US has now become the largest producer of oil in the world, and thus our dependence on the Middle East is no longer.](https://money.cnn.com/2018/09/12/investing/us-oil-production-russia-saudi-arabia/index.html)

He has done this all the while going after America's enemies, killing Baghdadi and Soleimani, two of the most wanted terrorists in the world. He stepped up the bombing campaign against ISIS and attacked Syria for crossing the Red Line In The Sand**™** that his predecessor set (and never enforced). He has brought back the tried and true strategy of deterrence through strength, not appeasement, having done away with the Iran nuclear deal (that unfroze billions of dollars of Iran's assets on the promise not to build nuclear weapons).

[He has also negotiated the release of hostages from North Korea, Iran, and the Taliban.](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/rnc-2020-trump-appears-hostages-he-helped-bring-home-u-n1237960) [He has stepped up the war on human trafficking](https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/31/politics/donald-trump-combat-human-trafficking/index.html) leading to thousands of children being rescued over the past four years. He implemented the Right to Try, allowing terminal patients to skip the red tape for experimental treatments. [He took on Big Pharma and has worked to reduce prescription drug prices.](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/2020/08/11/why_big_pharma_is_fighting_trump_over_cheap_drugs_519738.html#!)

They say he's a sellout. But he has implemented policies that directly help the average American. He cut taxes for all tax brackets and all sizes of business, leading to the lowest unemployment rates for women, Hispanics, and blacks in history. [For the first time in decades, the average worker saw an increase in real wage growth.](https://www.factcheck.org/2019/06/are-wages-rising-or-flat/) His policies led to the greatest bull market the US has ever seen. He passed the USMCA trade agreement, replacing NAFTA, [something that achieved overwhelmingly bipartisan support.](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/12/19/21013178/usmca-trade-deal-passes-house-vote-approve-bipartisan-nafta-trump)

And why do people think he's a bad man? Everything I just mentioned is true and verifiable. They say he's a Russian puppet, but he was not the President that allowed Russia to waltz into Ukraine and Syria and take what they wanted (Thanks Obama). Trump has now been cleared twice of the 'Russian collusion' narrative, once by Robert Mueller, and once by a bipartisan Senate investigation.

Donald Trump became the 3rd President to be impeached, out of 45 Presidents in 230 years. [He was the first to be impeached without actually having a crime cited against him.](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2019/dec/12/paul-gigot/donald-trump-would-be-first-us-president-impeached/) Interesting how the Democrats no longer bring up his impeachment...

Let us not forget the Kavanaugh confirmation, and how the Democrats treated a man who had absolutely zero evidence or reason against him.

People blame him for the coronavirus pandemic, [when a significant amount of deaths come from nursing homes in Democratic states with Democratic governors, that ordered sick nursing home patients to stay in the homes](https://www.newsmax.com/us/house-oversight-elderly-vulnerable/2020/06/15/id/972323/).

[Joe Biden called Trump's travel ban fear mongering and xenophobic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAdzW-mRKTk). [Nancy Pelosi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZBFUA0JjFk)  encouraged Americans to gather in China Town to rebuke Trump's ""xenophobia"" AFTER the travel ban from China. Let us not forget, Trump imposed the travel ban while [the WHO was saying there was no evidence of human to human transmission](https://www.businessinsider.com/who-no-transmission-coronavirus-tweet-was-to-appease-china-guardian-2020-4?op=1) and [Dr. Fauci was saying there was nothing to worry about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqg2kQDlPKw).

And who is the alternative? Joe Biden, a man who has been in DC for 47 years, is responsible for the 1994 crime bill that put a generation of black men behind bars (the opposite of [President Trump's First Step Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Step_Act), allowing a pathway for non-violent drug offenders to be released with a fresh start). Joe Biden, a man with [a history of racist comments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TJpnGCHtnA) and [touching little girls inappropriately](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4PLSPvJ9BY). Joe Biden, Vice President to the first black President, who chose to do nothing about systemic racism for 8 years (because it only exists when they're not the ones in power, right?).

The Democrats are a party that want to eliminate the electoral college, pack the Supreme Court, make Puerto Rico and Washington DC a state to pack the House and Senate with more Democrats (in the case of DC, against the founding father's wishes, but I guess dying wishes only matter when coming form Democrats). They want to defund the police, restrict your Second Amendment right, open the borders, and send out hundreds of millions of blank ballots. Do these sound like the policies of people who are looking out for *you*? Or the policies of a party that is looking our for *themselves*?

We live in a world where black is white, up is down, war is peace, freedom is slavery, and ignorance is strength. Kyle Rittenhouse is apparently a murdering white supremacist, despite no evidence of him being a white supremacist [and just needing to watch the video to see it was clear as day self defense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSU9ZvnudFE).

Apparently White Supremacists are the greatest threat to this country. Antifa and BLM? The groups that riot, beat, loot, murder and burn stuff down? Yeah, according to Democrats they're no problem.

Liberals have come to be driven by blind hate. The same way the Bolsheviks were, the same way the Nazis were, the same way the Khmer Rouge were, the same way the Chinese Communist Party were. **No one ended up on the wrong side of history by thinking they were the bad guys.** They all thought they were righteous and justified.

And that is where we are at. The left has been driven up into such a blind rage, [driven by fake news and pure propaganda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ilHJOkY4k), that they are willing to let things escalate.

And that is why we must vote for Donald J. Trump. He is not perfect. He is not a god. But he has consistently done what is best for this country.

And remember, it's okay to be in the ideological minority. You know who was one of the first Presidents to win the electoral college but lose the popular vote? [Our party's first President, Abraham Lincoln.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1860_United_States_presidential_election) If we instead opted for a ranked popular vote, he would have never become President and a Southern Democrat would have won. And I'm sure we're all glad that that man became President.

If this does not convince you, I don't know what will.

God bless.

If you could share this with friends, family, people unsure about Trump, it would be greatly appreciated. I put a lot into this. Not **A LOT** but enough to be sad if no one ever sees it.

hy0voa,suspended:IBiteYou,2020-07-25 21:46:23+00,So you think that Trump is showing his Nazi tendencies and there's stormtroopers on the streets of Portland. Here's something that needs to be said:,"For as long as I can really REMEMBER Republican Presidents (Reagan) ...the left has called them **Nazis.**

When Trump was elected, you said he was a *wanna be dictator.*  You said he was going to find a way to declare martial law and be President forever.  Some of you who say and said this were the same people who scoffed and (rightfully) laughed when some on the right claimed that Obama would do this.

So ... what have we seen in the USA since Trump was elected?  A constant invective of leftist pap from the commie boot-licking media.

Attempts to remove him from office.  Again and again.  

Claims that detention centers for illegal immigrants that have existed under numerous Presidents are now ""Nazi concentration camps.""

And see, we had a national emergency in Covid 19.  If he was going to declare martial law and overstep, that was the *perfect* opportunity to do it.  ""Why isn't he doing more,"" you said.  Because it is the right and responsibility of the state governors to deal with their respective states.  But he DID OFFER FEDERAL help to those who needed and requested it.

Covid did NOT make Trump into a tyrant.

So what came next?  Camera footage of the George Floyd arrest.

Most of America was horrified and agreed that the police bore responsibility for misuse of force ... (even though, apparently, that particular neck hold was accepted as a restraint method for someone resisting in a *number* of different states.)

We were fairly united in condemning that.

But then the left, BLM and Antifa took the opportunity to encourage and promote widespread destruction across the USA.  Destruction that didn't just ""burn property""...(though that in itself IS BAD) but took the lives of people and police and ruined businesses and created an environment that gave rise to a part of Washington state trying to declare itself to be a totally DIFFERENT autonomous country until they figured out that they couldn't do that (legally) and renamed themselves to a ""protest"" zone.  And people died there.

For days we watched as people tried to break down barriers around the White House.  The DC government appears to have abdicated their responsibility to keep the peace and seemed to stand down as 60 secret service agents were injured over the course of days of attacks against the White House and ***you thought it was funny*** that they might have been concerned enough at one point to put the President in the bunker.  You damned fools who think attacking the White House was good?  You have NO IDEA the defenses unconventional and otherwise that the White House has to debilitate your ass quickly.  These idiots legitimately thought that they were going to storm the White House and you acted like it was their right to do it because they were really mad about George Floyd.

**...a man who was killed in a Democrat run state in a democrat run city.**

We gathered what this was all about very quickly...and we watched ALL the livestreams of the protesting.  Yeah...we saw the one where the cop pulled a gun on a guy...and we ALSO KNOW that it happened because someone came up behind a police supervisor with a brick and smashed him over the head with it.

You ignored the destruction and riots in favor of a narrative of blaming the cops for reacting to SENSELESS riots.  Cops that were in mostly liberal cities run by Democrats.  Riot cops using riot techniques responded to riots and you did surprised Pikachu face.

It's been months now with this lawlessness happening and Trump has repeatedly told Democrat governments to get it under control.

But your Democrat governments failed you.  They decided that destruction of businesses sometimes created over the lifetime of black owners who cried in the streets after they were looted and burned...that lives lost..that packs roaming the streets bent on violence and anarchy... all of these were ACCEPTABLE...

...because it was making the President look bad.

He showed AMAZING restraint.  60 secret service members were injured and a church torched before Barr said that the perimeter around the White House should be moved back.

Months of violent protests.  Months.

And your Democrat leaders let you stew in it.  They abandoned their civilians and turned on their police.  You need to understand that they REFUSED to act appropriately and put many of you in real danger of harm because its an election year and these riots are ""bad for Trump.""

If it seemed like there was no one to protect you... it's because there was not...except the FEDERAL government and the governors kept telling Trump, ""Don't you dare.""  They refused to protect you and when Trump said, ""You need to restore order or I'm going to have to help your citizens..."" they said, ""Don't you dare.""

And he didn't dare.  He didn't declare martial law.  

He repeatedly asked the Democrat governments to stop the violence and protect the citizens.

And they didn't.  Because the destruction and bloodshed was acceptable because it made Trump look bad.  And the media carried their water.  There were not stories about how Democrat cities were failing to maintain law and order...there were stories about how these ""protests"" were justified.

...maybe they think it made Trump look weak... maybe they were trying to bait Trump into sending in help so that they could scream that he was a Nazi.

These protests are ""against fascism and police brutality"" you say!

***...So why the hell is the worst of it in Portland?***

Does Portland have a fascist government?  WTF are you even protesting there?  Portland is ""weird"".  Portland is antifa central.  You little shits harass innocent motorists there and the cops stand down.  Portland's NOT a fascist city.  But the trained Marxists of BLM and the violent anti-capitalist revolutionaries of antifa burned down the police union building, locked cops in a building and tried to burn it and are trying to burn a federal building.

**So now y'all got some federal attention.  And you've clutched your pearls to yell, ""Brownshirts!""**  

No... the BROWNSHIRTS are you little commie and otherwise criminal miscreants who have been making the streets unsafe across the USA for months.

MY GAWD...you called the Tea Party ""un-american terrorists""...but if they had pulled a QUARTER of the shit y'all have pulled...you would have had a POINT.

They pulled NONE OF IT.

**YOU ARE DOMESTIC TERRORISTS.**

You got naked women and alleged grandmas out there now for your human shield.  Are kids next?

And it's about time someone dealt with your FEDERAL crimes because your inept leftist leaders have put innocents in the way of violence over POLITICS.

Your cause is no longer just.

You need to stop doing violence.

Cowardly democrat leaders need to stop LETTING you get away with it.

Now the feds are in Portland.

**""They are unmarked brownshirts!""**

They ARE marked, but they don't look like your local officers, because they aren't. You have shown the kind of harm you mean to do to police who are identified.  You have already killed MARKED police officers.

When the unmarked mommy van pulls up and arrests you, I'm not thinking ""Fascism has come to America.""

I'm thinking, ""It's about FUCKING time.""

You complained about ""armed militias"" protesting the covid shutdown, [but yesterday an armed black militia member ""accidentally"" discharged a weapon and shot other protestors.](https://abcnews.go.com/US/members-armed-militia-shot-breonna-taylor-protest/story?id=71990031)

And you have the nerve to try to insist that we need to join you now in your protest because Trump has federal marshals on the streets?  Not just no...but HELL NO.

xb14i,deleted,2012-07-28 11:12:14+00,My Issues with the Gay Rights movement,"First of all I want to say I am positing this here rather then /r/politics because I thik I more likely to get the discussion I want here then the obama zombie downvotes I would get there. Second I'm not going to start off saying weather or not I support gay marriage because I'm sick of people going ""I support gay marriage but..."" because they are afraid of the ridiculous reaction if they don't post that. You should be able to tell from what I'm writing.

First off, lets get one thing out of the way, Being gay has one big component and that is gay sex, if you don't have gay sex, you are just attracted to the same gender as yourself. I think a lot of people discount the ACT of gay sex in their discussions. It seems that it has been decreed as an ACTION that cannot be judged, which I find kind of ridiculous, but I will bring this point up again when I get to gay marriage.

Gay Kids are on the Front Line
I think the Gay Rights movement has put gay kids on the front line. Admittedly I think this would also happen without the gay rights movement, but I don't think the gay rights movement tries to shield gay kids, because it is not in their best political interest. There is a lot of emphasis put on coming out and being out and proud, and I think that is detrimental to some kids who just want to get through high school and move on to a community where they won't be treated like crap because they are the only ones who are different. I can see in some sense it may be a good idea to expose highschoolers to different sexualities early on for the sake of tolerance, but I think in most cases kids will be dicks until they mellow out around the age they get in to college. This is just a maturity thing. So in some cases there is no good reason for these ay kids to come out until college when there is a local community they can turn to. The counter point to this may be that kid who killed himself after his roommate tried to watch him having sex through a web cam. Perhaps if the room mate had been exposed to more gay people early on he wouldn't have done such a thing. Or he was just a dick who didn't like his room mate and would have tried to web cam him even if he brought a girl in to the room.

The Gay Hissy Fit
This is currently going on with Chick-Fil-A. When the country didn't overnight go ""Oh ok same sex marriage"" it seems a lot of people had really bad over the top reactions. Same Sex marriage is a HUGE social change. Marriage has mainly been between a man and a woman. Sure it has also mainly been a property transaction, a political move, a way to consolidate power, but even in those cases, it was between a man and a woman. (There is apparently some evidence of the very early church doing some kind of consecration of a same sex relationship, but it was more or less declaring the people to be brothers, not married) This isn't going to chance over night. There is nothing in the constitution about Same sex marriage because when you suggested to someone back then that two men might want to marry eachother, they would have looked at you funny. It was so obvious they they figured they didn't need to add anything about it. No, they didn't even figure. The over reactions to a differing opinion on the mater do not help the movement and in fact hurt it because it sets up a ""with us or against us"" situation. I think the issue of same sex marriage will be sorted out mainly with time, telling me I'm awful because I like Chick-Fil-A isn't going to help. The violent reactions to the people that supported Prop 8 probably just justified their donations in their eyes.

Same Sex Marriage
I just want to try and spell out what I think the problem people have with same sex marriage. The biblical passage basically point out that the ACT of gay sex is wrong. So people who believe it find gay sex to be immoral. Basically if you don't think gay sex is immoral you should have no problem with same sex marriage, plain and simple. However if you do find it immoral, you are going to have an issue with an official recognition of a relationship where that action occurs because it is forcing something on you, from your perspective. This is the only example I could think up that works I think. So some people like Dominant submissive sexual situations, maybe they take it so far that s that s lives as a slave with D. In their home s is D's slave. D and s decide that they want the world to treat them how they act inside their home, so they go to court and say they want a slave marriage where s is officially declared the slave of D, and s is officially property. A judge finally goes, well you are two consenting adults, and if s really wants it I will declare that s if officially property that belongs to D. So now everybody has to treat s as property, if s works a job his/her wages have to go in to Ds account because s is property and can't have a bank account, if s is seen driving around without D, the police have to bring s back to Ds house and so on and so forth. Some people might find that they don't want to do this because they think treating people as property as wrong and don't want the courts to tell them ""too bad, this is what they want"" so they then go ahead and try to make Slave marriage illegal. I'm pretty sure it breaks down because the Constitution expressly forbids slavery, but you get the idea. I think there is a lot of dicussion that doesn't happen because the gay rights movement just labels people as bigots and full of hate and that just hardens their hearts against gay rights and gay families. I don't have a solution for what they should be doing, but I don't certain things are working.

jphbzr,6ckoiswa,2020-11-06 16:52:10+00,I read this and almost cried. Exactly what I was thinking. It is so sad.,"I never dreamed that I would have to face the prospect of not living in the United States of America, at least not the one I have known all my life. I have never wished to live anywhere else. This is my home and I was privileged to be born here.

But today I woke up and as I had my morning coffee, I realized that everything is about to change. No matter how I vote, no matter what I say, something evil has invaded our nation, and our lives are never going to be the same.

I have been confused by the hostility of family and friends. I look at people I have known all my life--so hate-filled that they agree with opinions they would never express as their own. I think that I may well have entered the Twilight Zone.

You can't justify this insanity. We have become a nation that has lost its collective mind!

• Somehow it’s un-American for the census to count how many Americans are in America.

• Russians influencing our elections are bad, but illegals voting in our elections are good.

• It was cool for Joe Biden to ""blackmail"" the President of Ukraine, but it’s an impeachable offense if Donald Trump inquires about it.

• Twenty is too young to drink a beer, but eighteen is old enough to vote.

• People who have never owned slaves should pay slavery reparations to people who have never been slaves.

• People who have never been to college should pay the debts of college students who took out huge loans for their degrees.

• Immigrants with tuberculosis and polio are welcome, but you’d better be able to prove your dog is vaccinated.

* Irish doctors and German engineers who want to immigrate to the US must go through a rigorous vetting process, but anyone who jumps the southern fence illegally is welcome.

• $5 billion for border security is too expensive, but $1.5 trillion for “free” health care is not.

* If you cheat to get into college you go to prison, but if you cheat to get into the country you go to college for free.

• People who say there is no such thing as gender are demanding a female President.

• We see other countries going Socialist and collapsing, but it seems like a great plan to us.

• Some people are held responsible for things that happened before they were born, and other people are not held responsible for what they are doing right now.

• Criminals are caught-and-released to hurt more people, but stopping them is bad because it's a violation of THEIR rights.

• And pointing out all this hypocrisy somehow makes us ""racists""?!

Nothing makes sense anymore, no values, no morals, no civility and people are dying of a Chinese virus, but it racist to refer to it as Chinese even though it began in China.
We are clearly living in an upside down world where right is wrong and wrong is right, where moral is immoral and immoral is moral, where good is evil and evil is good.

Wake up America, the great unsinkable ship Titanic America has hit an iceberg, is taking on water, and is sinking fast. The choice is yours to make. What will it be? Time is short, make your choice wisely!

(Not my words but very accurate and disturbing!)

199fgre,o9526q0ps,2024-01-17 18:44:34+00,Alt-right music calls for armed insurrection,"TLDR: Today, I discovered two musical ""artists"" whose music is nothing short of incitement, sedition, and bigotry: Adam Calhoun and Tom MacDonald.

I am in the Army National Guard. I was on duty today with a few other soldiers in my unit. We went on a short roadtrip. While I was driving, one of the guys in the vehicle with me connected his phone to the bluetooth so we could have ad free music. This was all well and good, until a series of songs written by the aforementioned ""artists"" came on. Theirs songs center around advocating for armed insurrection, belittling minorities, white supremacy, and conspiracy theories. Here are some sample lyrics: 

“Racism is gay, if you're offendеd, that's retarded / And tolerance is great until you speak and you're a target / If a white man paints his face black, he's a racist piece of garbage / But you put him in a dress and he's courageous and he's gorgeous.”

""Why you think we own these guns / So we can just go do some hunting? / You must not play close attention / Government, they want division
Only treason if you lose / I guarantee we come out winning...  My people of this country and we're under attack / They banning us, they cancel us for speaking the facts / If you man enough, come stand with us, take USA back"" 

There's plenty more where that came from; feel free to google it if you want to find more. Anyway, while I suppose I shouldn't be shocked that such music exists, I was absolutely appalled that this would be acceptable to one of my fellow service members, given our oath to defend the constitution and not commit treason. I was also rather annoyed that someone would play music that has anti-LGBT messaging, considering that soldier (and nearly everyone in my unit) knows I am gay. 

Aside from making the remainder of the trip particularly uncomfortable, this experience has made seriously question the integrity of the U.S. military and the degree of infiltration by the far-right. I have known many soldiers in the past several years who I know I could trust to uphold their oath; I have also known quite a few others who would readily listen to this music if they knew it existed.

Go on google news right now, its full of articles with titles like ""Trump's potential return"", ""sheer panic"" etc, Its still about a year a way, he likely lost bunch of nikki haley supporters, bidens polls are gradually going up. I'm all for warning about trump, and we should keep it up and not give up about doing so, but its just a nominee win. They are acting like its a sure thing now, remember they thought he'd win in 2020 too.

It's likely just the news trying to sensationalize, like they are doing with the Germany ww3 scenario thing. Countries constantly have war games for the worst case scenario all the time, it doesn't mean its going to happen. Still, I wish they would stop with the impending   doom all the time. 

I actually think the whole thing is kind of dangerous, because it will push the idea that Trump is going to win, and when he doesn't there will be another Jan 6th. And I fear it might even be worse.

Edit: Someone just  actually changed my opinion about this.

It might end up having the same effect on Republican voters   the way the news did with Democrats in 2016 by causing them to get too relaxed and not show up.

RotW: Hey, did you see the sportsball game last night?

America: Here's our primaries!

RotW: Was that my phone? It sounded like my phone.

America: They're not held simultaneously, but in an order determined by tradition and local politics! Two small states go first and eliminate many of the candidates! Some of our most populous states go near the end of the process, often after the nominee has been effectively selected!

RotW: (fidgets uncomfortably, looks at phone not very surreptitiously) Wow, it's getting late...

America: Here's the system used in the very first vote! Remember, the population is less than some of our cities!

RotW: (stands up, puts on coat, heads towards door) Yeah, see, we've got an important election of our own tomorrow...

America: On Sunday? Why don't you do important national decisions on Tuesdays like we do? Sure, it makes things difficult in today's world, but it made perfect sense two hundred years ago!

RotW: (leaving, with urgency) I... I... I just got a text from my babysitter. The baby's throwing up. And the dog...

America: Funny, I didn't hear a text message tone.

RotW: It. Is. On. Vibrate.

""Its not true."" or ""If it was true, it would have already been used against him. They are only doing it to persecute him."" Or ""Even if he did it, it's not as bad as what the Democrats/Clinton do."" Or ""So what? Half the country is Communist vermin.""

I barely understood English at the time, and to be honest, I didn't really pay attention to the lyrics until recently, when the song came on the radio while I was driving in my car.

Now one line in particular stuck with me: ""Does your pretty face see what he's worth?"" What is he worth? According to the logic of the song, his worth became apparent only after his successful career as a rock star with sold-out shows - an easily objectifiable high socio-economic status. This may be a stretch, but doesn't it say something about a society when you can find such clear meritocratic motifs even in the lyrics of a teen punk song?

Every few years since 2002, new arguments have been put forward to predict the imminent decline of the United States as the world's leading economic and military power. Meanwhile, every few years, the next technological innovation was born, or at least took off, on U.S. soil. With the advent of generative AI, the next technological revolution is dawning, and once again, U.S. companies and universities are at the forefront, while we Europeans pale in the face of American innovation and entrepreneurship [...]

Why do the media and politicians ignore this?,"My husband and I are like a lot of others. We were forced to move to Mexico to be able to retire.  My husband spent most of his lifetime helping make small fortunes for the three successful companies he worked for.  He was a dedicated employee, sometimes to the detriment of family life.  In the late 2000s, his 401K retirement took devastating hits like many others through no fault of ours.  In 2016, serious health reasons forced him to retire two years early.  Even with medical records and Dr's recommendations, the Social Security Administration denied his disability claim, and it would have possibly taken up to 2 years to fight in the courts.  We did not have the funds to fight for that long.  We were forced into accepting an early retirement penalty, which would make him lose about $500.00 a month in Social Security.  So we did the only thing we could do: say goodbye to everything we ever knew and move to a country where we didn't even speak the language.  We aren't even allowed to use our Medicare here.  We are not alone.  Mexico is full of seniors like us thrown away like garbage when they no longer were of use to the rich.  To say that we are bitter would be putting it lightly.  The US should be ashamed, but you do not hear any politicians even talking about this dirty secret, on either side, really.  The media doesn't even report on it.

I was wondering if other people on here wish that Barack Obama were more involved in the day to day political battle in this country? do you wish that he had a nightly show on CNN or MSNBC? and separate from that, do you think that such a show, or perhaps being at political rallies in much greater numbers or appearing on TV interviews multiple times per week, would significantly improve the Dems' chances of winning elections? and finally, on an 'ethical living' level, do you think that Obama has a responsibility to do more on a day to day basis than he seems to be? I know that he couldn't accomplish the long-term things that he cares about if he was having to do a TV show every day. I'm just not sure what would benefit others the most.

curious if I'm alone and holding him up to unfair expectations.

I was in Grant Park that surprisingly warm November 2008 evening when he gave that victory speech.
