The party that always chooses whoever gets backed by the military industrial complex despite constantly preaching that we’re the “anti-war” party.

The party that claims the “diversity” party despite propping up the worst possible female candidates they could find to make the rich old dudes seem more relatable.

The party that still won’t shut the fuck up about Kamala Harris despite being out of the race for months and being the most useless sack of shit that can’t debate to save her own life.

The party that allows Mike Fucking Bloomberg a chance to speak about safety and privacy policy despite being the most authoritarian one in the entire race.

The party that talks down and belittles any and all underneath them even if you agree with them with the media. To them if you’re a democrat in their eyes you’re a weak little sheep that has to coddled and told what to think and how to act, if you’re not you’re a mindless slave to the trump administration or a nazi.

That party that eats away at its own party members for stepping out of line. Andrew Yang, Tulsi Gabbard, and Bernie Sanders are prime examples of this. They’d rather get destroyed by Trump by choosing Biden’s old jittering ass, than put up a fight with either of these three. Yang can’t win because he’s just too down to earth and believes in worker’s well-being. Tulsi can’t win because she actually wants out of the Middle East because she served there and cares way too much for Veterans. Sanders can’t win because he wants to expand health care among the middle and lower class. 

Oh but Biden isn’t Trump so he’s perfect! Sure his brain has to work overtime in order to comprehend more than a few sentences at a time and he’s basically just a show pony for the Obama years, but c’mon guys he isn’t the orange guy and that’s all we need!

Oh sweet jumping Jesus, the DNC. Never in my life have I seen a more corrupt, shit slinging organization in my life. The amount of times the DNC has been caught pushing favoritism or stealing votes from one candidate to another is on the level of dystopian nightmare, 1984 type of shit.

I am a member of a third party(Libertarian) and am sick of the dems and reps throwing the ball back and forth to systematically divide the country while they profit. a two-party system thrives off division. and ""the stakes"" get higher every election... George Washington said that political parties would destroy the country. Abraham Lincon said a house divided amongst itself cannot stand.

throw your hate. refuse to believe you can be wrong on anything. see where it leads. democracy is not perfect. but it is better than authoritarianism. it is better than a dictatorship. and it is better than a societal collapse. when we as a people are unwilling to compromise or admit to being wrong we risk the very heart of the nation. you see people lash out and try to kill government officials both Democrats and Republicans alike. you see people claim that someone who doesn't agree with them on everything as a false citizen. this type of attitude can, has, or will lead to the end of nations large and small. the united states is no different.

I didn’t really grow up practicing Judaism. I always felt like antisemitism wasn’t really a thing that would ever affect me.

""I don't see the glaring evidence that says we need to move forward. I didn't see it in the Trump case, and voted against it, I don't see it in this case.""
* Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) told Axios: ""I don't know that there have been any high crimes or misdemeanors alleged. If there are, that would be a matter to consider, but until something like that is alleged, I don't know what the purpose of that inquiry might be.""
* ""If we start converting impeachments into no-confidence votes and we don't do the homework ... then I'm not going to take it seriously,"" said Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), another leadership member.

Even Tuberville thinks it's bullshit LOL.  TUBERVILLE!

Sorry trolls, but your little impeachment fantasy ain't gonna happen.  The GOP knows it's political suicide and would lose them everything in 2024.

We are now living in 1930s NAZI Germany where having the wrong political views got people sent to Dachau concentration camp.

Details here:

Dachau  was one of the first\[a\] concentration camps built by Nazi Germany and  the longest running one, opening on 22 March 1933. The camp was  initially intended to intern Hitler's political opponents which  consisted of: communists, social democrats, and other dissidents. It is  located on the grounds of an abandoned munitions factory northeast of  the medieval town of Dachau, about 16 km (10 mi) northwest of Munich in  the state of Bavaria, in southern Germany. After its opening by Heinrich  Himmler, its purpose was enlarged to include forced labor,and,  eventually, the imprisonment of Jews, Romani, German and Austrian  criminals, and, finally, foreign nationals from countries that Germany  occupied or invaded. The Dachau camp system grew to include nearly 100  sub-camps, which were mostly work camps or Arbeitskommandos, and were  located throughout southern Germany and Austria.

With the election going on I figured I would try and get a perspective from the other side. I would like to say that the vast majority of you all seem like great people. I know that Reddit leans so far left that it might fall off the edge of the internet eventually, so I understand how being republican/conservative on this app can be frustrating. I actually agree with a lot of the points and arguments you guys make, I do disagree with some, but not nearly as many as I thought I would. I just think that it's the far extremists on both sides that are making everything seem so damn polarized right now. In reality, I bet 95% of us want similar things, but the media makes it seem as though we are polar opposites. I'm not sure about you all but I am tired of all of this. I am tired of the hate from the extremists on both ends, I'm tired of the politics smothering social media platforms, I am tired of this awful tension in the air all the time, and I am tired of being told that other Americans are my ""enemy"". I want to feel united as a country, not divided. After reading a ton of posts here over the past two days it seems like a lot of you all feel the same.

&#x200B;

Edit 1: I would like to say that the overwhelmingly large amount of positivity in the comments is great to see. Also, I know it's not a lot of upvotes so far but it's the most I've ever received on Reddit so thank you all so much.

&#x200B;

Edit 2: Thank you all for the awards, I feel like I need to prepare a speech or something. But as I mentioned before, all the messages and comments that I have seen so far have been nothing but overwhelmingly positive. It gives me a lot of hope for the future.

j4m2st,g5w7n,2020-10-03 13:24:14+00,The case for Donald J. Trump: A comprehensive guide to why we should re-elect him and reject the Democratic party.,"So for the first time in my life I voted early. Primarily so I don't need to take time off on election day, but also because this is the most consequential election since 1860.

I know that gets thrown around a lot. But it's seemingly true in every way.

To anyone on the fence about Trump, anyone thinking about sitting this one out, any liberal lurkers here looking for a different point of view. Here's why I voted for Donald J. Trump and you should too.

Washington has failed everyday Americans for decades. The establishment cares only about the interest of lobbyists. Most politicians see a significant increase in net worth after becoming a politician. It's often thrown around that Trump became President to serve his own financial interests. [But Donald Trump has lost over 30% of his net worth since becoming President, more than $1 billion.](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/trump-has-lost-1-billion-personal-wealth-running-president-n916221) Trump is a billionaire, he's an old man, he could have retired in peace and luxury, but he didn't. He took on the most stressful job in the world, and sacrificed immensely to do so. If that doesn't say something about his character, I don't know what does.

They say he's a warmonger, but he is the first President since Jimmy Carter (1977-1981) to not get America involved in a new armed conflict. He has drawn down troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. He has averted conflicts with Venezuela and Iran. He has helped negotiate peace deals between North and South Korea, Serbia and Kosovo, and Israel and several Arab states, earning him three nominations for the Nobel Peace Prize. [Due to his domestic policies, the US has now become the largest producer of oil in the world, and thus our dependence on the Middle East is no longer.](https://money.cnn.com/2018/09/12/investing/us-oil-production-russia-saudi-arabia/index.html)

He has done this all the while going after America's enemies, killing Baghdadi and Soleimani, two of the most wanted terrorists in the world. He stepped up the bombing campaign against ISIS and attacked Syria for crossing the Red Line In The Sand**™** that his predecessor set (and never enforced). He has brought back the tried and true strategy of deterrence through strength, not appeasement, having done away with the Iran nuclear deal (that unfroze billions of dollars of Iran's assets on the promise not to build nuclear weapons).

[He has also negotiated the release of hostages from North Korea, Iran, and the Taliban.](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/rnc-2020-trump-appears-hostages-he-helped-bring-home-u-n1237960) [He has stepped up the war on human trafficking](https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/31/politics/donald-trump-combat-human-trafficking/index.html) leading to thousands of children being rescued over the past four years. He implemented the Right to Try, allowing terminal patients to skip the red tape for experimental treatments. [He took on Big Pharma and has worked to reduce prescription drug prices.](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/2020/08/11/why_big_pharma_is_fighting_trump_over_cheap_drugs_519738.html#!)

They say he's a sellout. But he has implemented policies that directly help the average American. He cut taxes for all tax brackets and all sizes of business, leading to the lowest unemployment rates for women, Hispanics, and blacks in history. [For the first time in decades, the average worker saw an increase in real wage growth.](https://www.factcheck.org/2019/06/are-wages-rising-or-flat/) His policies led to the greatest bull market the US has ever seen. He passed the USMCA trade agreement, replacing NAFTA, [something that achieved overwhelmingly bipartisan support.](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/12/19/21013178/usmca-trade-deal-passes-house-vote-approve-bipartisan-nafta-trump)

And why do people think he's a bad man? Everything I just mentioned is true and verifiable. They say he's a Russian puppet, but he was not the President that allowed Russia to waltz into Ukraine and Syria and take what they wanted (Thanks Obama). Trump has now been cleared twice of the 'Russian collusion' narrative, once by Robert Mueller, and once by a bipartisan Senate investigation.

Donald Trump became the 3rd President to be impeached, out of 45 Presidents in 230 years. [He was the first to be impeached without actually having a crime cited against him.](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2019/dec/12/paul-gigot/donald-trump-would-be-first-us-president-impeached/) Interesting how the Democrats no longer bring up his impeachment...

Let us not forget the Kavanaugh confirmation, and how the Democrats treated a man who had absolutely zero evidence or reason against him.

People blame him for the coronavirus pandemic, [when a significant amount of deaths come from nursing homes in Democratic states with Democratic governors, that ordered sick nursing home patients to stay in the homes](https://www.newsmax.com/us/house-oversight-elderly-vulnerable/2020/06/15/id/972323/).

[Joe Biden called Trump's travel ban fear mongering and xenophobic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAdzW-mRKTk). [Nancy Pelosi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZBFUA0JjFk)  encouraged Americans to gather in China Town to rebuke Trump's ""xenophobia"" AFTER the travel ban from China. Let us not forget, Trump imposed the travel ban while [the WHO was saying there was no evidence of human to human transmission](https://www.businessinsider.com/who-no-transmission-coronavirus-tweet-was-to-appease-china-guardian-2020-4?op=1) and [Dr. Fauci was saying there was nothing to worry about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqg2kQDlPKw).

And who is the alternative? Joe Biden, a man who has been in DC for 47 years, is responsible for the 1994 crime bill that put a generation of black men behind bars (the opposite of [President Trump's First Step Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Step_Act), allowing a pathway for non-violent drug offenders to be released with a fresh start). Joe Biden, a man with [a history of racist comments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TJpnGCHtnA) and [touching little girls inappropriately](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4PLSPvJ9BY). Joe Biden, Vice President to the first black President, who chose to do nothing about systemic racism for 8 years (because it only exists when they're not the ones in power, right?).

The Democrats are a party that want to eliminate the electoral college, pack the Supreme Court, make Puerto Rico and Washington DC a state to pack the House and Senate with more Democrats (in the case of DC, against the founding father's wishes, but I guess dying wishes only matter when coming form Democrats). They want to defund the police, restrict your Second Amendment right, open the borders, and send out hundreds of millions of blank ballots. Do these sound like the policies of people who are looking out for *you*? Or the policies of a party that is looking our for *themselves*?

We live in a world where black is white, up is down, war is peace, freedom is slavery, and ignorance is strength. Kyle Rittenhouse is apparently a murdering white supremacist, despite no evidence of him being a white supremacist [and just needing to watch the video to see it was clear as day self defense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSU9ZvnudFE).

Apparently White Supremacists are the greatest threat to this country. Antifa and BLM? The groups that riot, beat, loot, murder and burn stuff down? Yeah, according to Democrats they're no problem.

Liberals have come to be driven by blind hate. The same way the Bolsheviks were, the same way the Nazis were, the same way the Khmer Rouge were, the same way the Chinese Communist Party were. **No one ended up on the wrong side of history by thinking they were the bad guys.** They all thought they were righteous and justified.

And that is where we are at. The left has been driven up into such a blind rage, [driven by fake news and pure propaganda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ilHJOkY4k), that they are willing to let things escalate.

And that is why we must vote for Donald J. Trump. He is not perfect. He is not a god. But he has consistently done what is best for this country.

And remember, it's okay to be in the ideological minority. You know who was one of the first Presidents to win the electoral college but lose the popular vote? [Our party's first President, Abraham Lincoln.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1860_United_States_presidential_election) If we instead opted for a ranked popular vote, he would have never become President and a Southern Democrat would have won. And I'm sure we're all glad that that man became President.

If this does not convince you, I don't know what will.

God bless.

If you could share this with friends, family, people unsure about Trump, it would be greatly appreciated. I put a lot into this. Not **A LOT** but enough to be sad if no one ever sees it.

hy0voa,suspended:IBiteYou,2020-07-25 21:46:23+00,So you think that Trump is showing his Nazi tendencies and there's stormtroopers on the streets of Portland. Here's something that needs to be said:,"For as long as I can really REMEMBER Republican Presidents (Reagan) ...the left has called them **Nazis.**

When Trump was elected, you said he was a *wanna be dictator.*  You said he was going to find a way to declare martial law and be President forever.  Some of you who say and said this were the same people who scoffed and (rightfully) laughed when some on the right claimed that Obama would do this.

So ... what have we seen in the USA since Trump was elected?  A constant invective of leftist pap from the commie boot-licking media.

Attempts to remove him from office.  Again and again.  

Claims that detention centers for illegal immigrants that have existed under numerous Presidents are now ""Nazi concentration camps.""

And see, we had a national emergency in Covid 19.  If he was going to declare martial law and overstep, that was the *perfect* opportunity to do it.  ""Why isn't he doing more,"" you said.  Because it is the right and responsibility of the state governors to deal with their respective states.  But he DID OFFER FEDERAL help to those who needed and requested it.

Covid did NOT make Trump into a tyrant.

So what came next?  Camera footage of the George Floyd arrest.

Most of America was horrified and agreed that the police bore responsibility for misuse of force ... (even though, apparently, that particular neck hold was accepted as a restraint method for someone resisting in a *number* of different states.)

We were fairly united in condemning that.

But then the left, BLM and Antifa took the opportunity to encourage and promote widespread destruction across the USA.  Destruction that didn't just ""burn property""...(though that in itself IS BAD) but took the lives of people and police and ruined businesses and created an environment that gave rise to a part of Washington state trying to declare itself to be a totally DIFFERENT autonomous country until they figured out that they couldn't do that (legally) and renamed themselves to a ""protest"" zone.  And people died there.

For days we watched as people tried to break down barriers around the White House.  The DC government appears to have abdicated their responsibility to keep the peace and seemed to stand down as 60 secret service agents were injured over the course of days of attacks against the White House and ***you thought it was funny*** that they might have been concerned enough at one point to put the President in the bunker.  You damned fools who think attacking the White House was good?  You have NO IDEA the defenses unconventional and otherwise that the White House has to debilitate your ass quickly.  These idiots legitimately thought that they were going to storm the White House and you acted like it was their right to do it because they were really mad about George Floyd.

**...a man who was killed in a Democrat run state in a democrat run city.**

We gathered what this was all about very quickly...and we watched ALL the livestreams of the protesting.  Yeah...we saw the one where the cop pulled a gun on a guy...and we ALSO KNOW that it happened because someone came up behind a police supervisor with a brick and smashed him over the head with it.

You ignored the destruction and riots in favor of a narrative of blaming the cops for reacting to SENSELESS riots.  Cops that were in mostly liberal cities run by Democrats.  Riot cops using riot techniques responded to riots and you did surprised Pikachu face.

It's been months now with this lawlessness happening and Trump has repeatedly told Democrat governments to get it under control.

But your Democrat governments failed you.  They decided that destruction of businesses sometimes created over the lifetime of black owners who cried in the streets after they were looted and burned...that lives lost..that packs roaming the streets bent on violence and anarchy... all of these were ACCEPTABLE...

...because it was making the President look bad.

He showed AMAZING restraint.  60 secret service members were injured and a church torched before Barr said that the perimeter around the White House should be moved back.

Months of violent protests.  Months.

And your Democrat leaders let you stew in it.  They abandoned their civilians and turned on their police.  You need to understand that they REFUSED to act appropriately and put many of you in real danger of harm because its an election year and these riots are ""bad for Trump.""

If it seemed like there was no one to protect you... it's because there was not...except the FEDERAL government and the governors kept telling Trump, ""Don't you dare.""  They refused to protect you and when Trump said, ""You need to restore order or I'm going to have to help your citizens..."" they said, ""Don't you dare.""

And he didn't dare.  He didn't declare martial law.  

He repeatedly asked the Democrat governments to stop the violence and protect the citizens.

And they didn't.  Because the destruction and bloodshed was acceptable because it made Trump look bad.  And the media carried their water.  There were not stories about how Democrat cities were failing to maintain law and order...there were stories about how these ""protests"" were justified.

...maybe they think it made Trump look weak... maybe they were trying to bait Trump into sending in help so that they could scream that he was a Nazi.

These protests are ""against fascism and police brutality"" you say!

***...So why the hell is the worst of it in Portland?***

Does Portland have a fascist government?  WTF are you even protesting there?  Portland is ""weird"".  Portland is antifa central.  You little shits harass innocent motorists there and the cops stand down.  Portland's NOT a fascist city.  But the trained Marxists of BLM and the violent anti-capitalist revolutionaries of antifa burned down the police union building, locked cops in a building and tried to burn it and are trying to burn a federal building.

**So now y'all got some federal attention.  And you've clutched your pearls to yell, ""Brownshirts!""**  

No... the BROWNSHIRTS are you little commie and otherwise criminal miscreants who have been making the streets unsafe across the USA for months.

MY GAWD...you called the Tea Party ""un-american terrorists""...but if they had pulled a QUARTER of the shit y'all have pulled...you would have had a POINT.

They pulled NONE OF IT.

**YOU ARE DOMESTIC TERRORISTS.**

You got naked women and alleged grandmas out there now for your human shield.  Are kids next?

And it's about time someone dealt with your FEDERAL crimes because your inept leftist leaders have put innocents in the way of violence over POLITICS.

Your cause is no longer just.

You need to stop doing violence.

Cowardly democrat leaders need to stop LETTING you get away with it.

Now the feds are in Portland.

**""They are unmarked brownshirts!""**

They ARE marked, but they don't look like your local officers, because they aren't. You have shown the kind of harm you mean to do to police who are identified.  You have already killed MARKED police officers.

When the unmarked mommy van pulls up and arrests you, I'm not thinking ""Fascism has come to America.""

I'm thinking, ""It's about FUCKING time.""

You complained about ""armed militias"" protesting the covid shutdown, [but yesterday an armed black militia member ""accidentally"" discharged a weapon and shot other protestors.](https://abcnews.go.com/US/members-armed-militia-shot-breonna-taylor-protest/story?id=71990031)

And you have the nerve to try to insist that we need to join you now in your protest because Trump has federal marshals on the streets?  Not just no...but HELL NO.

7. I voted Democrat because I think illegal aliens have a right to free health care, education, and Social Security benefits, and we should take away the social security from those who paid into it.

xb14i,deleted,2012-07-28 11:12:14+00,My Issues with the Gay Rights movement,"First of all I want to say I am positing this here rather then /r/politics because I thik I more likely to get the discussion I want here then the obama zombie downvotes I would get there. Second I'm not going to start off saying weather or not I support gay marriage because I'm sick of people going ""I support gay marriage but..."" because they are afraid of the ridiculous reaction if they don't post that. You should be able to tell from what I'm writing.

First off, lets get one thing out of the way, Being gay has one big component and that is gay sex, if you don't have gay sex, you are just attracted to the same gender as yourself. I think a lot of people discount the ACT of gay sex in their discussions. It seems that it has been decreed as an ACTION that cannot be judged, which I find kind of ridiculous, but I will bring this point up again when I get to gay marriage.

Gay Kids are on the Front Line
I think the Gay Rights movement has put gay kids on the front line. Admittedly I think this would also happen without the gay rights movement, but I don't think the gay rights movement tries to shield gay kids, because it is not in their best political interest. There is a lot of emphasis put on coming out and being out and proud, and I think that is detrimental to some kids who just want to get through high school and move on to a community where they won't be treated like crap because they are the only ones who are different. I can see in some sense it may be a good idea to expose highschoolers to different sexualities early on for the sake of tolerance, but I think in most cases kids will be dicks until they mellow out around the age they get in to college. This is just a maturity thing. So in some cases there is no good reason for these ay kids to come out until college when there is a local community they can turn to. The counter point to this may be that kid who killed himself after his roommate tried to watch him having sex through a web cam. Perhaps if the room mate had been exposed to more gay people early on he wouldn't have done such a thing. Or he was just a dick who didn't like his room mate and would have tried to web cam him even if he brought a girl in to the room.

The Gay Hissy Fit
This is currently going on with Chick-Fil-A. When the country didn't overnight go ""Oh ok same sex marriage"" it seems a lot of people had really bad over the top reactions. Same Sex marriage is a HUGE social change. Marriage has mainly been between a man and a woman. Sure it has also mainly been a property transaction, a political move, a way to consolidate power, but even in those cases, it was between a man and a woman. (There is apparently some evidence of the very early church doing some kind of consecration of a same sex relationship, but it was more or less declaring the people to be brothers, not married) This isn't going to chance over night. There is nothing in the constitution about Same sex marriage because when you suggested to someone back then that two men might want to marry eachother, they would have looked at you funny. It was so obvious they they figured they didn't need to add anything about it. No, they didn't even figure. The over reactions to a differing opinion on the mater do not help the movement and in fact hurt it because it sets up a ""with us or against us"" situation. I think the issue of same sex marriage will be sorted out mainly with time, telling me I'm awful because I like Chick-Fil-A isn't going to help. The violent reactions to the people that supported Prop 8 probably just justified their donations in their eyes.

Same Sex Marriage
I just want to try and spell out what I think the problem people have with same sex marriage. The biblical passage basically point out that the ACT of gay sex is wrong. So people who believe it find gay sex to be immoral. Basically if you don't think gay sex is immoral you should have no problem with same sex marriage, plain and simple. However if you do find it immoral, you are going to have an issue with an official recognition of a relationship where that action occurs because it is forcing something on you, from your perspective. This is the only example I could think up that works I think. So some people like Dominant submissive sexual situations, maybe they take it so far that s that s lives as a slave with D. In their home s is D's slave. D and s decide that they want the world to treat them how they act inside their home, so they go to court and say they want a slave marriage where s is officially declared the slave of D, and s is officially property. A judge finally goes, well you are two consenting adults, and if s really wants it I will declare that s if officially property that belongs to D. So now everybody has to treat s as property, if s works a job his/her wages have to go in to Ds account because s is property and can't have a bank account, if s is seen driving around without D, the police have to bring s back to Ds house and so on and so forth. Some people might find that they don't want to do this because they think treating people as property as wrong and don't want the courts to tell them ""too bad, this is what they want"" so they then go ahead and try to make Slave marriage illegal. I'm pretty sure it breaks down because the Constitution expressly forbids slavery, but you get the idea. I think there is a lot of dicussion that doesn't happen because the gay rights movement just labels people as bigots and full of hate and that just hardens their hearts against gay rights and gay families. I don't have a solution for what they should be doing, but I don't certain things are working.

jphbzr,6ckoiswa,2020-11-06 16:52:10+00,I read this and almost cried. Exactly what I was thinking. It is so sad.,"I never dreamed that I would have to face the prospect of not living in the United States of America, at least not the one I have known all my life. I have never wished to live anywhere else. This is my home and I was privileged to be born here.

But today I woke up and as I had my morning coffee, I realized that everything is about to change. No matter how I vote, no matter what I say, something evil has invaded our nation, and our lives are never going to be the same.

I have been confused by the hostility of family and friends. I look at people I have known all my life--so hate-filled that they agree with opinions they would never express as their own. I think that I may well have entered the Twilight Zone.

You can't justify this insanity. We have become a nation that has lost its collective mind!

• Somehow it’s un-American for the census to count how many Americans are in America.

• Russians influencing our elections are bad, but illegals voting in our elections are good.

• It was cool for Joe Biden to ""blackmail"" the President of Ukraine, but it’s an impeachable offense if Donald Trump inquires about it.

• Twenty is too young to drink a beer, but eighteen is old enough to vote.

• People who have never owned slaves should pay slavery reparations to people who have never been slaves.

• People who have never been to college should pay the debts of college students who took out huge loans for their degrees.

• Immigrants with tuberculosis and polio are welcome, but you’d better be able to prove your dog is vaccinated.

* Irish doctors and German engineers who want to immigrate to the US must go through a rigorous vetting process, but anyone who jumps the southern fence illegally is welcome.

• $5 billion for border security is too expensive, but $1.5 trillion for “free” health care is not.

* If you cheat to get into college you go to prison, but if you cheat to get into the country you go to college for free.

• People who say there is no such thing as gender are demanding a female President.

• We see other countries going Socialist and collapsing, but it seems like a great plan to us.

• Some people are held responsible for things that happened before they were born, and other people are not held responsible for what they are doing right now.

• Criminals are caught-and-released to hurt more people, but stopping them is bad because it's a violation of THEIR rights.

• And pointing out all this hypocrisy somehow makes us ""racists""?!

Nothing makes sense anymore, no values, no morals, no civility and people are dying of a Chinese virus, but it racist to refer to it as Chinese even though it began in China.
We are clearly living in an upside down world where right is wrong and wrong is right, where moral is immoral and immoral is moral, where good is evil and evil is good.

Wake up America, the great unsinkable ship Titanic America has hit an iceberg, is taking on water, and is sinking fast. The choice is yours to make. What will it be? Time is short, make your choice wisely!

(Not my words but very accurate and disturbing!)

199fgre,o9526q0ps,2024-01-17 18:44:34+00,Alt-right music calls for armed insurrection,"TLDR: Today, I discovered two musical ""artists"" whose music is nothing short of incitement, sedition, and bigotry: Adam Calhoun and Tom MacDonald.

I am in the Army National Guard. I was on duty today with a few other soldiers in my unit. We went on a short roadtrip. While I was driving, one of the guys in the vehicle with me connected his phone to the bluetooth so we could have ad free music. This was all well and good, until a series of songs written by the aforementioned ""artists"" came on. Theirs songs center around advocating for armed insurrection, belittling minorities, white supremacy, and conspiracy theories. Here are some sample lyrics: 

“Racism is gay, if you're offendеd, that's retarded / And tolerance is great until you speak and you're a target / If a white man paints his face black, he's a racist piece of garbage / But you put him in a dress and he's courageous and he's gorgeous.”

""Why you think we own these guns / So we can just go do some hunting? / You must not play close attention / Government, they want division
Only treason if you lose / I guarantee we come out winning...  My people of this country and we're under attack / They banning us, they cancel us for speaking the facts / If you man enough, come stand with us, take USA back"" 

There's plenty more where that came from; feel free to google it if you want to find more. Anyway, while I suppose I shouldn't be shocked that such music exists, I was absolutely appalled that this would be acceptable to one of my fellow service members, given our oath to defend the constitution and not commit treason. I was also rather annoyed that someone would play music that has anti-LGBT messaging, considering that soldier (and nearly everyone in my unit) knows I am gay. 

Aside from making the remainder of the trip particularly uncomfortable, this experience has made seriously question the integrity of the U.S. military and the degree of infiltration by the far-right. I have known many soldiers in the past several years who I know I could trust to uphold their oath; I have also known quite a few others who would readily listen to this music if they knew it existed.

Go on google news right now, its full of articles with titles like ""Trump's potential return"", ""sheer panic"" etc, Its still about a year a way, he likely lost bunch of nikki haley supporters, bidens polls are gradually going up. I'm all for warning about trump, and we should keep it up and not give up about doing so, but its just a nominee win. They are acting like its a sure thing now, remember they thought he'd win in 2020 too.

It's likely just the news trying to sensationalize, like they are doing with the Germany ww3 scenario thing. Countries constantly have war games for the worst case scenario all the time, it doesn't mean its going to happen. Still, I wish they would stop with the impending   doom all the time. 

I actually think the whole thing is kind of dangerous, because it will push the idea that Trump is going to win, and when he doesn't there will be another Jan 6th. And I fear it might even be worse.

Edit: Someone just  actually changed my opinion about this.

It might end up having the same effect on Republican voters   the way the news did with Democrats in 2016 by causing them to get too relaxed and not show up.

But we know the backwards right has used disinformation to prop up Trump and their policies. We also know AI really took off last year. I just read a business [report](https://www.oliverwymanforum.com/global-consumer-sentiment/how-will-ai-affect-global-economics/introduction.html) that asked people if they could tell AI from real images and it's scary that people can't tell the diference.

America: Wanna see how we select the candidates for the office?

RotW: Hey, did you see the sportsball game last night?

America: Here's our primaries!

RotW: Was that my phone? It sounded like my phone.

America: They're not held simultaneously, but in an order determined by tradition and local politics! Two small states go first and eliminate many of the candidates! Some of our most populous states go near the end of the process, often after the nominee has been effectively selected!

RotW: (fidgets uncomfortably, looks at phone not very surreptitiously) Wow, it's getting late...

America: Here's the system used in the very first vote! Remember, the population is less than some of our cities!

RotW: (stands up, puts on coat, heads towards door) Yeah, see, we've got an important election of our own tomorrow...

America: On Sunday? Why don't you do important national decisions on Tuesdays like we do? Sure, it makes things difficult in today's world, but it made perfect sense two hundred years ago!

RotW: (leaving, with urgency) I... I... I just got a text from my babysitter. The baby's throwing up. And the dog...

America: Funny, I didn't hear a text message tone.

RotW: It. Is. On. Vibrate.

Whether its the fake elector scheme, the Epstein list, or the parallels to Nazism, they turn a blind eye to it. When presented with evidence, they simply state: 

""Its not true."" or ""If it was true, it would have already been used against him. They are only doing it to persecute him."" Or ""Even if he did it, it's not as bad as what the Democrats/Clinton do."" Or ""So what? Half the country is Communist vermin.""

I barely understood English at the time, and to be honest, I didn't really pay attention to the lyrics until recently, when the song came on the radio while I was driving in my car.

Now one line in particular stuck with me: ""Does your pretty face see what he's worth?"" What is he worth? According to the logic of the song, his worth became apparent only after his successful career as a rock star with sold-out shows - an easily objectifiable high socio-economic status. This may be a stretch, but doesn't it say something about a society when you can find such clear meritocratic motifs even in the lyrics of a teen punk song?

Every few years since 2002, new arguments have been put forward to predict the imminent decline of the United States as the world's leading economic and military power. Meanwhile, every few years, the next technological innovation was born, or at least took off, on U.S. soil. With the advent of generative AI, the next technological revolution is dawning, and once again, U.S. companies and universities are at the forefront, while we Europeans pale in the face of American innovation and entrepreneurship [...]

That's the shameful immigration problem conservatives will never complain about or even slightly mention quietly. Why do the media and politicians ignore this?,"My husband and I are like a lot of others. We were forced to move to Mexico to be able to retire.  My husband spent most of his lifetime helping make small fortunes for the three successful companies he worked for.  He was a dedicated employee, sometimes to the detriment of family life.  In the late 2000s, his 401K retirement took devastating hits like many others through no fault of ours.  In 2016, serious health reasons forced him to retire two years early.  Even with medical records and Dr's recommendations, the Social Security Administration denied his disability claim, and it would have possibly taken up to 2 years to fight in the courts.  We did not have the funds to fight for that long.  We were forced into accepting an early retirement penalty, which would make him lose about $500.00 a month in Social Security.  So we did the only thing we could do: say goodbye to everything we ever knew and move to a country where we didn't even speak the language.  We aren't even allowed to use our Medicare here.  We are not alone.  Mexico is full of seniors like us thrown away like garbage when they no longer were of use to the rich.  To say that we are bitter would be putting it lightly.  The US should be ashamed, but you do not hear any politicians even talking about this dirty secret, on either side, really.  The media doesn't even report on it.  I guess we do not even exist to them.  When the pandemic hit, it was Mexico who made sure we were safe and got COVID-19 shots because the US said that we were the problem of the country we chose to live in.

Do I send that money to feed the poor overseas or do I buy that new shirt that I've been eyeing? I've especially been thinking about this in light of the new MLK, Jr. biography.

To that end, the post-presidency of Barack Obama has been, perhaps like his presidency, fairly underwhelming to me. At least from my point of view, he doesn't seem that interested in ensuring Democratic victories these days. Like a lot of wealthy people, he seems less passionate about politics than he used to.

I was wondering if other people on here wish that Barack Obama were more involved in the day to day political battle in this country? do you wish that he had a nightly show on CNN or MSNBC? and separate from that, do you think that such a show, or perhaps being at political rallies in much greater numbers or appearing on TV interviews multiple times per week, would significantly improve the Dems' chances of winning elections? and finally, on an 'ethical living' level, do you think that Obama has a responsibility to do more on a day to day basis than he seems to be? I know that he couldn't accomplish the long-term things that he cares about if he was having to do a TV show every day. I'm just not sure what would benefit others the most.

curious if I'm alone and holding him up to unfair expectations.

Trump's current political campaign revolves around revenge, and it's clear that if he gets in he will do everything he can to take complete control of the state, and I think there's a very high chance he will be successful. So if that happens, what next? Will there be mass-killings? Will there be a cultural revolution like in Maoist China where everyone that voted democrat is subjected to dehumanization? Obviously, it'll be the end of liberal democracy in the United States, but what will that mean for the world: will China have free reign to invade Taiwan, Russia be able to go all out on Ukraine, and eventually, the 3 superpowers take over all the other liberal democracies. Will it mean world-autocracy? 

&#x200B;

I'll be honest, I'm fucking shitting myself, waiting for this election to happen. The breath of fresh air I will take when Biden wins will be the most glorious one of my life, but until then, I'm left worrying. Obviously, I'm going to do everything I can to make sure Trump doesn't get in, and if there's a civil war afterwards, you can bet that I'll be fighting - but I want to know what you guys think, whether I'm just being paranoid about what's gonna happen, that's what my family seems to think, but I feel like with a demagogue like Trump, whose closer to Hitler than Putin or Xi (who I think are actually stable psychopaths while Trump is an unstable sociopath), there's no telling the calamity that will ensue from his gaining power.

19fboi5,im23oix4a,2024-01-25 07:18:35+00,What Democrats can do to help," Right now, many Democrats feel powerless to stop Trump from winning the Republican nomination. THERE IS SOMETHING WE CAN DO TO HELP but many voters do not realize that crossover primary voting is an option. 

**If you are a Democrat living in one of these 16 states, you can vote in the Republican primary instead of the (largely symbolic) Democratic primary:** Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Hawaii, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, and Wisconsin

Across the 16 states with open primaries, there are 791 delegates (of the estimated 2,429) in play and Trump needs 1,215 or more delegates to win the primary. Diverting some of these delegates to Nikki Haley (the lesser of two evils) will weaken Trump's chances of winning the nomination. 

**Share this information on social media and with Democrats in your state to help defeat Trump in the primary.**

Trump is not a cultist, hes not an atheist either, and he CERTAINLY is not a fool.

Hes a christian.

Just because Whaddo You Meme lied to you and said that Donald Trump was a satanist panzee in his video titled ""Donald Trump's Religious Beliefs are NOT what You Think.."" doesnt mean he was telling the truth.

Donald Trump was the very LAST ACTUAL HUMAN PRESIDENT weve ever had, aside from Barack Obama, George Washington, or even Ronald Reagan, the rest of them have just been child-eating reptilians that you guys praise for their ""diversity""

The media doesnt need this ""W O K E"" GARBAGE era of the internet anymore.

Rigging the 2024 Elections not gonna fix it either, its just gonna cause the Second Civil War, because trust me, as soon as that 87-year-old dementia-infested geriatric patient presses the big button with Hillary's name on it, WHEREVER it may be in the Oval Office, trust me, its DEFINITELY there somewhere, Hillary's gonna go dump all them fraudulent ballots with the names BIDEN/HARRIS on em into the ballot box and his voting count is gonna go through the roof, and fair Elections where Republican and Democrat verbally debate one-another, and people ACTUALLY get to decide who they want to vote for, are going to be gone for good, and its going to be a natural disaster caused by a fake Election.

And thats if Joe can even LIVE long enough to SEE the 2024 Election take place before hes going to be EVENTUALLY put under anesthaesia just like Vladimir Putin is.

But either way, if he DOES somehow survive, and live to see a rigged Election where he wins automatically without even having to EARN the votes like every other candidate has had to do, its going to be an all-out political and physical war.

So if youre going to remove this post, at least have the courage to actually say WHY, and cut this woke rainbow gay crap that Koala Harry tries and fails to compare to the way water works, so that we can all live in peace.

Joe Biden will actively lie about his son.

Getting rid of bail and being soft on crime still doesn't work for the 4th year in a row.

Don't put Newsome on a debate stage with Desantis on a channel that won't actively shill for him.

Democrats will actively make up hate crimes to push a political agenda(Jussie Smollet, Bubba Wallace, that teacher at FSU)

Republicans need to chill on Trump and Haley

Trump DOJ made it so that an [impeachment subpoena is only valid if an impeachment inquiry vote has been taken first](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/mccarthy-opened-biden-impeachment-inquiry-house-vote-matter/story?id=103149958), that was to help Trump. The vote was taken for Jim Jordan's subpoena, it wasn't ~~and still hasn't been yet~~ for Hunter Biden subpoena. ~~They don't have the votes, so they can't issue subpoenas.~~

2. **Hunter Biden agreed to testify to them in public**, they originally asked fo that. What's the problem? What do MAGA's have to hide?

They have to hide [Jim Jordan's attempt to push a Russian attack package](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/cia-other-spy-agencies-told-white-house-about-rudy-giuliani-n1243718) as if it was an FBI whistleblower complaint. He tried to pretend there were credible claims, and hide the fact that those claims are simply a Russian election attack from a [Russian military intelligence officer named Andrii Derkach](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/12/07/politics/russia-intel-agent-charged-us-sanctions-2020-elections/index.html).

[Jim Jordan](https://www.newsweek.com/jim-jordan-involvement-jan-6-revealed-committee-report-1769235), [Josh Hawley](https://www.newsweek.com/josh-hawleys-prominent-jan-6-role-lies-blasted-home-state-papers-1772074) and the rest have very good reason to avoid subpoenas. They were deeply involved in the planning, marketing and execution of the Jan 6th coup plot.

The non-MAGA Republicans need to ask themselves if they want to be party to this shit show. Do they really want to align themselves to these MAGAs and their Russian handlers? No, they didn't commit the crimes that Jim Jordan and Josh Hawley and Trump committed, so they shouldn't do the time.",Democrat,https://www.reddit.com/r/Democrat/comments/18i7up4/republicans_rage_after_hunter_biden_snubs_subpoena/,"{""url"":""https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/hunter-biden-defies-subpoena-enraging-republicans-1234927466/""}","{""link"":null,""author"":null}","{""list"":null,""total_awards_count"":0,""total_awards_price"":0}","{""2024-02-02T04:57:53"":2}","{""2024-02-02T04:57:53"":0.67}","{""2024-02-02T04:57:53"":1}",false,false,false,

I'm not sure what to do. Reddit needs to be abandoned, but where else can we go? And going somewhere else does not solve the problem of Reddit having become a national security risk that may be greater than others, because of how easy it is to become a mod and sabotage entire subs.

18do25r,hh003oro,2023-12-08 06:31:04+00,Proposed Bill for Enhancing Accountability for Social Media Influencers,"Hey everyone,

I came across this proposed bill aiming to regulate and hold social media influencers accountable for their online conduct. The bill introduces verification obligations, ethical guidelines, and penalties for misinformation. What are your thoughts on these measures? Do you think this kind of regulation is necessary or could it hinder online freedom? Let's discuss it.

Note: This bill is not being proposed by the government nor someone in government, but a regular citizen, in expanded from, it would do the following:

&#x200B;

**Enhanced Oversight of Social Media Influencer Conduct and Responsibility Act**

**Objective:** This legislation aims to regulate social media influencers by establishing guidelines, ethical standards, and verification processes to ensure responsible behavior and prevent the dissemination of harmful misinformation.

**Key Provisions:**

**Verification Obligation:** Influencers with over 10,000 followers must verify the accuracy of information they share, using credible sources before publication. An oversight agency will regulate this process.

**Liability for Misinformation:** Influencers are held accountable for sharing false or misleading information that causes harm, requiring them to prove the accuracy of their claims.

**Penalties and Enforcement:** The severity of penalties for violations (such as fines or sanctions) will be based on the impact of the misinformation. An oversight body will enforce compliance.

**Ethical Conduct Guidelines:** Influencers must adhere to a code of conduct, refraining from hate speech, discrimination, or actions threatening public safety.

**Parental Responsibility for Underage Influencers:** Parents or guardians of underage influencers must ensure compliance with the bill's provisions.

**Minimum Age Requirement:** Individuals must be 18 to independently engage in influencer activities. Those aged 14-18 can participate with parental consent and oversight.

**Penalties for Influencer-Induced Death:** If an influencer's actions lead to an individual's death, the influencer may face criminal charges, fines, and imprisonment.

**Investigation and Judicial Proceedings:** A thorough investigation process will precede judicial proceedings, ensuring a fair trial for influencers accused of misconduct.

**Enforcement and Implementation:** An oversight agency will monitor compliance, collaborate with social media platforms, and conduct awareness programs.

**Funding and Resource Allocation:** The bill allocates funds for the effective implementation and operation of the oversight agency.

**Purpose:** The bill seeks to create a safer online environment, protect against the spread of misinformation, and hold social media influencers accountable for their actions and content.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Edit: I will be posting the Proposed Bill here just in case:

The word fascism can be used interchangeably with Nazism, found advertised using Nazi flags and symbolism on display at MAGA rallies, protests and attempted insurrection.

Venezuela is going to invade Guyana to take 60% of the country, across a border that's been settled more than 100 years ago.  What the article doesn't say is that the vote was 97-98% in favor.  Does that sound like North Korea or Soviet Union style balloting?

18absd7,xtaog,2023-12-03 20:00:17+00,"QUICK HISTORY: Fast demise of the German-American Bund Nazi Party, following Madison Square Garden rally. Leader soon convicted of embezzlement - sentenced to prison at Sing Sing Correctional Facility.","The height of the German-American Bund’s popularity was marked by the February 1939 rally at Madison Square Garden. Kuhn and other American Nazi leaders called the event a “mass demonstration for true Americanization” and used patriotic imagery alongside Nazi imagery and antisemitic rhetoric. Twenty-two thousand Bund members carried signs and banners with messages such as, “Wake up America! Smash Jewish Communism” and “Stop Jewish Domination of Christian Americans.” Speakers at the rally incorporated antisemitic messages and Nazi propaganda throughout their speeches. Messages which were openly praised by attendants who performed Nazi salutes toward three-story tall banners of George Washington flanked by Nazi swastikas. In Fritz Kuhn’s keynote address, he demanded that “…our government be returned to the American People who founded it.” The Bund’s definition of Americanism was actually a concrete manifestation of German racism and hatred based on racial and religious differences. Hermann Schwinn, the West Coast leader of the Bund, reinforced that idea when he labeled Jews as a threat to American identity and attacked New York City Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia as “the Jew Lumpen LaGuardia.”

......

Within a year of the German-American Bund rally in Madison Square Garden, the organization and their support collapsed. The Nazi invasion of Poland in September 1939, and declarations of war from France and the United Kingdom, eroded support for the American Nazi movement. Shortly after, Kuhn was convicted of embezzlement of funds from the Bund and was sentenced to prison at Sing Sing Correctional Facility. Within a year, every leader of the Bund was interned or jailed as dangerous aliens, and by the end of December 1941, the US Government outlawed the German-American Bund. In 1942, Kuhn’s citizenship was dissolved and he was deported to West Germany in 1945.

The collapse of the German-American Bund was not the end of the pro-Nazi movement in the United States. The America First Committee, whose spokesperson was Charles Lindbergh, was founded in 1940 to support American isolation and Nazi appeasement. Lindbergh crossed the country to hold rallies that blamed Roosevelt and American Jews for pushing the country closer to war. The America First Committee dissolved once the United States entered World War II.

Despite the short-lived histories of these organizations, American society has seen echoes of their ideologies. In 1978, American Nazis attempted to march and rally in Skokie, Illinois. President Trump revived the name “America First” as a slogan for anti-immigrant propaganda. Today, the “Alt-Right” have taken up the mantle of white supremacy and Nazism in the United States. The Unite the Right Rally marched in Charlottesville, Virginia in 2017 chanting Nazi and antisemitic slogans while carrying torches, Nazi flags, and white supremacist imagery. Most recently, at the siege of the US Capital in January 2021, cameras caught Americans in “Camp Auschwitz” and “6MWE” (6 Million Wasn’t Enough) shirts and an abundance of antisemitic, fascist and hate speech, conspiracy theories, and propaganda. The enduring Nazi and white supremist ideologies and rhetoric in the United States remains a lasting and dangerous legacy of the 1939 German-American Bund Rally at Madison Square Garden and the larger American Nazi Movement of the 1930s.

1875giq,suspended:TheBlazingPhoenix1,2023-11-29 17:01:02+00,Uncomfortable pills about guns for Dems to swallow,"#### ""God made man, but Sam Colt made him equal.""

Guns are the great equalizer. It puts a 120lb woman on equal footing to a 250lb male rapist, and she can take him down with the pull of a finger. This is the primary reason I'm pro-gun. Without them, it's a dog eat dog, might makes right world. 

#### See the 20th Century.

Governments murdered up to 250 million of their own citizens (not including wars) in the 20th Century alone. This isn't ancient history, this was practically yesterday. Without arms, we are all completely at the mercy of the people who have arms. And we know where that leads. I.e. whole towns of people being marched out into the woods at gunpoint, shot in the back of the head, and buried in mass graves. And of course, gun bans preceded all of this. 

#### Bans don't work.

When government bans something, it doesn't disappear, it just goes underground and into the black market. See War on Drugs. And in the black market, there are no restrictions whatsoever on gun ownership. The kids being gunned down in America are being gunned down by other kids who are already in possession of illegal firearms they're to young to own. The law doesn't prevent this and no new laws would either.

#### Banning guns will be racist in practice

Most gun deaths are the result of inner city gangs fighting each other in the streets. So for a ban to be effective in lowering these numbers means the cops will have to target these neighborhoods especially. Which will look and feel racist as fuck in practice, even if it's not intentionally so. 

#### Cops have no obligation to defend us. 

The Supreme Court has ruled time and time again that cops have no obligation to protect us. So to make cops our only protector is a surefire way to have no protection from criminality at all. Which we are already seeing in places like Chicago and San Francisco, where those who defend themselves from criminals are charged with crimes.",Democrat,https://www.reddit.com/r/Democrat/comments/1875giq/uncomfortable_pills_about_guns_for_dems_to_swallow/,,"{""link"":null,""author"":null}","{""list"":null,""total_awards_count"":0,""total_awards_price"":0}","{""2024-02-02T05:09:13"":1}","{""2024-02-02T05:09:13"":0.54}","{""2024-02-02T05:09:13"":0}",false,false,false,

184g42g,4c6tbp30,2023-11-26 09:40:35+00,Democrat Goals,"   

&#x200B;

CURRENT DEMOCRAT GOALS (Items in **bold**):

1. U.S. acceptance of coexistence as the only alternative to atomic war.

2. U.S. willingness to capitulate in preference to engaging in atomic war.

3. Develop the illusion that total disarmament \[by\] the United States would be a demonstration of moral strength.

4. Permit free trade between all nations regardless of Communist affiliation and regardless of whether or not items could be used for war.

5. Extension of long-term loans to Russia and Soviet satellites.

6. Provide American aid to all nations regardless of Communist domination.

7. Grant recognition of Red China. Admission of Red China to the U.N.

8. Set up East and West Germany as separate states in spite of Khrushchev’s promise in 1955 to settle the German question by free elections under supervision of the U.N.

9. Prolong the conferences to ban atomic tests because the United States has agreed to suspend tests as long as negotiations are in progress.

10. Allow all Soviet satellites individual representation in the U.N.

11. Promote the U.N. as the only hope for mankind. If its charter is rewritten, demand that it be set up as a one-world government with its own independent armed forces. (Some Communist leaders believe the world can be taken over as easily by the U.N. as by Moscow. Sometimes these two centers compete with each other as they are now doing in the Congo.)

12. Resist any attempt to outlaw the Communist Party.

13. Do away with all loyalty oaths.

14. Continue giving Russia access to the U.S. Patent Office.

15. Capture one or both of the political parties in the United States.

16. **Use technical decisions of the courts to weaken basic American institutions by claiming their activities violate civil rights**.

**17. Get control of the schools. Use them as transmission belts for socialism and current Communist propaganda. Soften the curriculum. Get control of teachers’ associations. Put the party line in textbooks.**

18. Gain control of all student newspapers.

19. Use student riots to foment public protests against programs or organizations which are under Communist attack.

20. **Infiltrate the press. Get control of book-review assignments, editorial writing, policymaking positions.**

21. **Gain control of key positions in radio, TV, and motion pictures**.

22. Continue discrediting American culture by degrading all forms of artistic expression. An American Communist cell was told to “eliminate all good sculpture from parks and buildings, substitute shapeless, awkward and meaningless forms.”

23. Control art critics and directors of art museums. “Our plan is to promote ugliness, repulsive, meaningless art.”

24. **Eliminate all laws governing obscenity by calling them “censorship” and a violation of free speech and free press**.

25. **Break down cultural standards of morality by promoting pornography and obscenity in books, magazines, motion pictures, radio, and TV.**

26. **Present homosexuality, degeneracy and promiscuity as “normal, natural, healthy.**”

27. **Infiltrate the churches and replace revealed religion with “social” religion. Discredit the Bible and emphasize the need for intellectual maturity which does not need a “religious crutch**.”

28. **Eliminate prayer or any phase of religious expression in the schools on the ground that it violates the principle of “separation of church and state.**”

29. Discredit the American Constitution by calling it inadequate, old-fashioned, out of step with modern needs, a hindrance to cooperation between nations on a worldwide basis.

30. **Discredit the American Founding Fathers. Present them as selfish aristocrats who had no concern for the “common man**.”

31. **Belittle all forms of American culture and discourage the teaching of American history on the ground that it was only a minor part of the “big picture.” Give more emphasis to Russian history since the Communists took over**.

32. **Support any socialist movement to give centralized control over any part of the culture–education, social agencies, welfare programs, mental health clinics, etc**.

33. Eliminate all laws or procedures which interfere with the operation of the Communist apparatus.

34. Eliminate the House Committee on Un-American Activities.

35. Discredit and eventually dismantle the FBI.

36. Infiltrate and gain control of more unions.

37. Infiltrate and gain control of big business.

38. Transfer some of the powers of arrest from the police to social agencies. Treat all behavioral problems as psychiatric disorders which no one but psychiatrists can understand \[or treat\].

39. Dominate the psychiatric profession and use mental health laws as a means of gaining coercive control over those who oppose Communist goals.

40. Discredit the family as an institution. Encourage promiscuity and easy divorce.

41. **Emphasize the need to raise children away from the negative influence of parents. Attribute prejudices, mental blocks and retarding of children to suppressive influence of parents**.

42. Create the impression that violence and insurrection are legitimate aspects of the American tradition; that students and special-interest groups should rise up and use \[“\]united force\[“\] to solve economic, political or social problems.

43. Overthrow all colonial governments before native populations are ready for self-government.

44. Internationalize the Panama Canal.

45. Repeal the Connally reservation so the United States cannot prevent the World Court

Joe Biden is the 5th consecutive president to call attacks on the Middle East. Yes it may have been retaliation but for what. Why do we still have countless bases in the Middle East. Why must we be there in the first place? Why is our country a non-stop war machine? Why are all our soldiers overseas for US interests? Why is our biggest expense on our military and these countless bases that in all reality the majority of our nation will never see? Why do we stand on our own two feet but all our allies have to be crutched? 

Let's make a demand for isolation. 
Let's make a demand for these countless bases to be handed over to our allies. 
Let's end the war machine. 
Let's demand for it all to end. 
We can spend the money here. 
Our soldiers can be trained in things other than war and when not holding a rifle be trained in building up our infrastructure, our medics can be deployed within our borders at free clinics, our air force can fly around our borders instead of in some far off country. 

During the last 5 Presidents the world moved ahead of us. We may have iPhones but Asia has high speed railways, Japan has security robots, Dubai has autonomous drone taxis, Europe has the most advanced particle physics laboratory(CERN) , and the tallest building is no longer within the US.  We fell behind in all but war. 

The lie the government has been selling us is that it's for protection or that it's in our interests. But tell me if our homes are not overseas than who are we protecting? Isnt it more in our interests to spend our money not outside of our borders? Our country is falling to shambles and we are being placated like children by deals at Walmart for a 10 dollar wrench that cost a dollar to make. (Random example) 

We could easily have built the most effective anti-missile/anti-aircraft/anti-weapon defense system with zero flaws but instead we built the most devastating weapons we could create. In the end what are we trying to achieve? Why have we been fed the sob stories of the world and why do we continue to intervene? What benefit does it have to every household in America that a man in a cave with a gun on the other side of the world is dead. Instead of just making our country more secure here where it matters we worried ourselves with people who have no access to us because we let our guard down 20 years ago . They hit us here because we weren't secure over here not over there.

I was handed a 7 day REDDIT ban for posting an OP piece, in which I expressed my pride in my liberal-minded daughter for realizing;

>Today our daughter has changed her  tune drastically. She now says Trump may have been somewhat abrasive,  but his policies all benefited the USA. She sees Biden tearing America  apart, piece by piece, in a rush toward disaster.

and that;

>I'm  very proud of my little girl. She doesn't drink the popular Kool-Aid of  the Libbies. She analyzes, compares, and reaches the only rational  conclusion.

The reason REDDIT gave for the 7 day site-wide ban;

>Your account has been suspended from Reddit for ***harassment***. The suspension will last 7 day(s).

I gravitated to this sub because its mission is to *reform* the Democrat party. But REDDIT has evidently decided that if anyone does not adhere to the orthodoxy of **The Woke**, they are harassing people and polluting their minds with...what...dangerous ideas of independence?

Another thing REDDIT does, is dish out these arbitrary bannings under the guise of an *automated bot*. The gutless wonders don't even have the personal fortitude to stand behind their own decisions, so they hide behind a bot.

So I'm gonna leave my account till the weekend, to see if I get banned for posting this...ever so dangerous OP and to see what responses there may be to this. For those of you out there who truly believe in arcane and dangerous ideas like *free speech* and *the free exchange of ideas*, I would implore you to find another place to go. I'm gonna try Parler and see what its all about.

It is the great **LIE** of **The Woke**, that things like *inclusion*, *unity, fairness, the laws of the land*...mean anything to them. They do not! What is paramount to **The Woke**...is the blind adherence to their orthodoxy. A purely *racist, communist, hateful* ideology that if left unchecked...is going to destroy the United States of America.

Biden DID NOT approve such a thing.

Here is the original memorandum that they edited:

They are trying to convince people that Biden has somehow signed approval for billions to Israel (magically without discussion or going through Congress).

They're also openly lying about the $6 billion in Iranian funds that was sent to accounts in South Korea to be released under US treasury approval to Qatar to purchase humanitarian aid. They're claiming Biden's given all that money to Iran/Hamas. This is FALSE. That money is still there awaiting approval for use.

Vote this November, and bring two friends with you.","From 2020 to 2022, Virginia had its first Democratic trifecta in decades, holding both houses of the General Assembly and the governor's seat.  During this time they took the opportunity to:

* Raise the minimum wage
* Pass sweeping environmental regulations
* Increase access to health care
* Decriminalize marijuana
* Ban no-knock warrants
* Eliminate the death penalty
* Ratify the Equal Rights Amendment
* And a host of other initiatives that help regular working people (source below for details)

It was like night and day after years of Republican obstruction.  But why were they able to get so much done while the current Congress isn't? The majorities in the VA General Assembly were *solid* majorities.  They weren't the razor-thin majority we have in the Senate right now.  They could have a few legislators in reddish districts dissent while still getting things done.

Democrats are well positioned to keep both houses of Congress this year,  We can even pick up seats in the Senate so Manchin's dissenting vote isn't the deciding one.

But we ALL need to get out and VOTE, vote in NUMBERS, and vote DEMOCRAT.

I think it's interesting that while a subsection of Democrats support these passports as a way to ensure a safe end to lockdowns, there are some who see them as a bad idea due to the inequality they can cause (as poorer people are less likely to be vaccinated than wealthier people, and therefore they create a segregation of sorts).

In any case, I'll link a video on the basics of these passports below... let me know what you think!

I'm going to ask the conservatives a similar question.

Do you really think this is real? Or maybe is this just another ""RUSSIA"" moment?

&#x200B;

My personal view...I would be shocked if Russian agents were NOT using the Internet to promote the candidate they prefer. The USA does it too. Hell a lot of nations use the Internet that way. Including...China.

So what are we afraid of here? That foreign nations would promote their interests, during a US election, on the Internet Apps that...American companies own?

After doing so by watching socialists like jimmy dore and tuning in to dnc primaries, I changed to a classical liberal. (I would presume people here are more left than that, but I considered it progress) used to belive in multiplayer healthcare now I support the public option, support legalizing all drugs (more of a libertarian thing but also kinda liberal), don’t agree with defunding the police but I don’t back the blue as they say, I would like to see qualified immunity gone, mandatory body cams for all police, more psychiatric participation, and mandatory 2 years training, and last but not least even tho it heavily against segregation I think it would be useful to have pocs police their own community at least for a time. 

The reason I abandoned conservatism was they aren’t as principled as they pretend to be. For example, they freaked tf out when kaepernivk kneaded and called for his firing, but that’s totally against his first amendment rights!

3bxyup,deleted,2015-07-02 19:08:59+00,Can someone explain what Sanders as president would mean for me?,"I'm 16 years old and I've been trying to get a gauge for this whole politics thing because I'll be eligible to vote in 2016. The two candidates that have caught my eye are Rand Paul and Bernie Sanders.

With Rand Paul I understand that he plans on cutting Federal Income Tax down to 15% for everyone. Which would mean less of my money would go to government etc.

With Bernie I understand that he will try to take money from the rich and give to the poor; like a robin hood character.

What I'm wondering is would I be one of those receiving aid or one of those whom he plans to take wealth from. (I don't plan on being a billionaire; I'm essentially just an average middle class student who plans on staying in the middle class).

I plan on majoring in finance when I go to university and I'm also wondering if Sanders attack on banks would hurt a finance major because I'd assume banks would be less enticed to hire entry-level financial analyst with less capital.

Writer Maggot Hagerman of the Failing New York Times wrote almost her entire FAKE story today about the Trump Hating Judge’s Gag Order (They love to silence me!), rather than the Racist Attorney General’s STAR witness chocking like a dog on the Witness Stand (Perry Mason?), and admitting that I NEVER asked him to do anything wrong. He also admitted that he lied to Congress Under Oath, AGAIN, brand new charges. THAT MEANS THEY NO LONGER HAVE A WITNESS, OR A CASE. She also failed to report that the Trump Hating Judge refuses to respect or accept the Appeals Court decision reversing him, a first! Maggot should focus her energies on Corrupt Prosecutors and Judges, whose hatred and bias is so great that they are unable to make a fair and reasonable decision. New York is crime ridden and dying, but I will save it in 2024… It can’t come too fast!

Donald J. Trump

The Attorney General case against me in New York State just lost its STAR witness, SleazeBag former attorney Michael Cohen (he was disbarred for lying, and more!), who admitted to lying in this case and clearly stated that I did nothing wrong. The unhinged Judge, a highly political and fully biased Trump Hater, refused to dismiss this HOAX of a case, and has lost all CREDIBILITY. Likewise, he refuses to accept the decision of the Appeals Court, a first in New York. He should be ashamed of himself for having ruled against me before the trial even started, and for not dismissing this RIGGED WITCH HUNT now that the facts are known and that their star witness has been totally discredited, actually ADMITTING TO LYING. It is a Travesty of Justice for all to see. Businesses are fleeing “the least business friendly State in the Nation!” Racist Attorney General Letitia James should focus on record setting Murder and other Violent Crimes, something she cares, or knows, nothing about!

Oct 26, 2023, 11:37 AM

Donald J. Trump

The Judge in the New York State A.G. case refuses to accept the overturning of his decisions by the Appeals Court. This is a first in the history of the State! HE HAS GONE CRAZY IN HIS HATRED OF “TRUMP.” Also, their “STAR” witness just admitted his statements were all a big lie. He broke down in court. The Radical Left Judge said he doesn’t care. He is trying to protect RACIST A.G. Letitia James, who has no case, lost the appeal, but has a tyrannical and unhinged Trump Hating Judge. She campaigned for A.G. on, “I Will Get Trump,” long before she knew anything about me. This is Judicial Misconduct, coupled with Prosecutorial Misconduct, and somebody from the State of New York must step in and stop this Complete & Total Miscarriage of Justice!

Oct 26, 2023, 10:28 AM

Donald J. Trump

The Radical Left Judge who should not be handling the FAKE & FULLY DISCREDITED CASE brought against me by the New York State A.G. (It should be handled by the Commercial Division, but should never have been brought!), fined me $10,000 yesterday under his so-called gag order. He is a judge that found me GUILTY before the trial even started, and long before he had the real facts, like Michael Cohen collapsing and choking yesterday under cross examination, and completely admitting that I did nothing wrong. He committed MASSIVE PERJURY, at a level seldom seen on the stand before. It was like watching the end of the best Petty Mason episode, where the defendant breaks down and cries, “Yes, I did it, I did it, I did it.” This case should be ended, NOW, but this Judge and his “boss,” Letitia Peekaboo James, will never let that happen. He even refuses to accept our big win in the Appeals Court. It is a disgrace to the legal system in the State of New York. This is a RIGGED CASE!

It's because he knows he doesn't have enough votes to proceed.

Rep. Mike Lawler (R-N.Y.), one of the most vulnerable House Republicans, said, ""The question me right now is, the investigations, are they producing enough facts and evidence that warrant taking it to the next step?  I don't think it's there at the moment.""

Many other Republican lawmakers agree.

NBC continues, reporting that, “The results of the investigation could be referred to federal prosecutors”

The Department of Homeland Security’s Inspector General informed the Secret Service tonight that the investigation is now criminal — and that it should put a stop to all internal investigations on the missing text messages so that evidence can be preserved.

She's damn right and y'all know it. Y'all fucking know it. The United-States is on the road to self-destruction because of all the late stage capitalism, mass consumerism, inaction about pollution and climate change, endless wars based on lies, dire poverty in some parts of the country, and the billionaires and top 1% hoarding all the wealth (them billionaires are born into wealth and never have to earn anything they have but if the poor and/or disabled who are UNABLE to work need a bit of government assistance they are told that they have to earn something or that they have to pull themselves up by their bootstraps).

Proof that there is no real meritocracy in the western world and that the system is rigged in favor of the uber rich and against the poor and/or disabled:

The United-States is on the road to self-destruction because U.S Americans let the uber rich and late stage capitalism take over the country and in their pride and arrogance they refuse to aknowledge that there is a problem and  they still think that the United-States of America is the ""best country in the world"" and ""the next best thing since sliced bread"". It is said that ""pride comes before the fall"", if that statement should apply to something it should be applied to the United-States of America.

And I'm not even talking about all the fucked up shit like babies in dog cages at the border. And there's the Republicans who claim to be ""Christians"", who claim to be ""followers of Jesus Christs"" but support putting babies in dog cages at the border and ripping nursing infants from their mothers' breasts while the mothers scream in anguish just because their parents crossed a line on the ground while being undocumented in an attempt to flee violence and persecution and save their children's lives. I'm a Center-Left Christian and this makes me very angry because those Republicans who do fucked up crap like this and are causing so much pain and suffering to those poor children and breaking up families, they are giving Christians and Christianity a bad name.

He too is telling it like it is:

Can anyone blame me for being so angry? When I see So many countries on the American continent and even abroad, including innocent children, suffer as a direct consequence of stupid and/or harmful things done or caused by the actions of the United-States of America, especially the U.S government, when I see people suffer because of late stage capitalism, mass consumerism, inaction about pollution and climate change, dire poverty in some parts of the country, and the billionaires and top 1% hoarding all the wealth, yes it does make me very angry. This is 2021 and the United-States of America should know better. The U.S and U.S Americans are not in a position to play world police and lecture other countries about morality and human rights. That's the pot calling the kettle black. As Jesus Himself said, before you look at the splinter in your neighbor's eye, take out the plank in your own eye.

I couldn't agree more with what these people said in their articles:

I have been trying to get an answer to this question, but not sure which subreddit to post it to. Upfront, I am not a Democrat or a Republican, I consider myself Libertarian. 

My question...The emails that were leaked by Wikileaks, and hacked by the Russians. Democrats have gone out of their way to say that the Russians attempted to influence our election by the hacking of the DNC and Podesta. But they have never spoken to the veracity of the information that was leaked, detailing corruption and collusion throughout the DNC. Why is it more important to say that Russian interference was a bigger deal, than talking about and confronting the corruption that was highlighted in the emails? Does it not matter that the people running the party are doing everything they can to lie to their party members in order to keep power?

We know what Trump would produce in another 4 years. He'd finish his wall. Probably start a trade war with China...likely have them turfed from the WTO as well. Throw his support to the other Nationalists up and coming in Europe.

And Ol' Joe? Well...none of the above...that's for sure. He'd likely find an excuse to have statues of General Washington torn down across the nation. Halt the wall and open the borders. Let people sleep in tents while the rich drive up all the real estate prices. Obamacare would make a come-back. Wally-Mart would be able to continue stocking ""Made in China"". Some of Europe would still fall to the Nationalists. ""Green"" restrictions would go up and the economy would get sluggish.

Using a peaceful protest as a cover for a coordinated attack on government facilities, isn't what they did during the BLM protests too?  They turned peaceful protests into rioting, looting, arson, and assault.  Antifa is a domestic terrorist organization.

• Why  is it that when archaeologists find human remains, they always  determine that they are either male or female and none of the other  hundreds of genders?

•  Why is it that so many are more outraged that Brittney Griner was stuck  in Russia than they were about Americans being stranded in Afghanistan?

• How is it that the government can’t control gasoline prices…but the weather is something they can fix?

•  We’re churning out a generation of poorly educated people with no  skill, no ambition, no guidance, and no realistic expectations of what  it means to go to work. —Mike Rowe

•  If kids knew what they wanted to be at age eight, the world would be  filled with cowboys and princesses. I wanted to be a pirate. Thank  goodness nobody took me seriously and scheduled me for eye removal and  peg leg surgery. —Bill Maher

•  Why were we told to lower our AC usage on hot days to prevent  overwhelming the electric grid while simultaneously being told to trade  in our gas cars for electric vehicles?

•  Why is canceling student debt a good idea? Does it make sense to reward  people who do not honor their financial commitment by taxing the people  who do?

• Does it make sense to cut off oil from an ally and buy it from an enemy who calls for your death?

• Are we living in a time where intelligent people are silenced so that stupid people won’t be offended?

• Is this a great description of America: Andy has left town and Barney is in charge?

•  Why is talking sexually in the workplace considered sexual harassment  to adults…but talking about sexuality to children K-3 at school  considered education?

• Who else had a ‘ministry of truth’…Hitler…Goebbels…Stalin?

• I saw a movie where only the police and military had guns; it was called Schindler’s List.

• If your electric car runs out of power on the interstate, do you walk to a charging station to get a bucket of electricity?

• Why are we running out of money for Social Security and Medicare and not for welfare, illegals, and free college?

• I just got a full tank of gas for $22. Granted, it was for my lawn mower, but I’m trying to stay positive.

• There is a coin shortage. America is officially out of common sense.

• If an 18-year-old isn’t mature enough to own a firearm, then maybe five year olds aren’t mature enough to change their gender

• Sign in Texas: DON’T VOTE FOR WHAT YOU FLED

**• Nobody called it “Toxic Masculinity when we were saving the world.**

**• Mice die in mouse traps because they do not understand why the cheese is free. Just like socialism.**

**•  The most powerful governments on earth can’t stop a virus from  spreading…but they say they can change the earth’s temperature if you  pay more taxes.**

**•  If you don’t want to stand for the national anthem, perhaps you should  give your legs to a veteran who lost his. That way a real man can stand  in your place.**

• If socialism is so good and capitalism is so bad…then why aren’t the caravans heading to Venezuela?

1156fha,tnie5is8,2023-02-17 20:08:21+00,Sleepy Joe Strikes Again: Ohio Gets No Disaster Relief After Train Derailment,"Well folks, it looks like President Biden and his liberal cronies in Washington have once again turned their backs on hardworking Americans in need.

Governor DeWine of Ohio recently requested federal disaster assistance following a train derailment that caused a dangerous chemical fire. But what did the Biden administration do? They rejected the request, claiming that the incident didn't qualify for aid. Typical!

Meanwhile, residents of East Palestine had to evacuate their homes and endure several days of toxic smoke and fallout. But no worries, Ohio was able to get some assistance through the Department of Health and Human Services for those needing medical care. That's great, I guess. But what about the rest of the community? They deserve better than this.

And let's not forget who's really responsible for this mess: Norfolk Southern, the company involved in the accident. Governor DeWine is holding them accountable, as he should. The people of East Palestine need to be made whole, and Norfolk Southern should be footing the bill for the damage they caused.

But instead of stepping up to help the community in their time of need, the Biden administration is playing politics and refusing to provide much-needed assistance. Shame on them!

Thankfully, FEMA is in constant contact with Governor DeWine's office and other agencies to assess the situation. But it's time for the Biden administration to do their part and provide the aid that Ohioans deserve. It's not a handout, it's a helping hand when it's needed most.",Democrat,https://www.reddit.com/r/Democrat/comments/1156fha/sleepy_joe_strikes_again_ohio_gets_no_disaster/,,"{""link"":null,""author"":null}","{""list"":null,""total_awards_count"":0,""total_awards_price"":0}","{""2024-02-02T08:22:13"":0}","{""2024-02-02T08:22:13"":0.5}","{""2024-02-02T08:22:13"":1}",false,false,false,

# THE CALIPH OF GOD OFFERS A PLAN FOR ANY ELECTED PRESIDENT.

**MY TEN DAY PLAN   :** 

**DAY ONE:   --Declare a state of emergency and use it to force congress into a constitutional convention.**

**DAY TWO: --Nationalize the Federal Reserve, and begin producing  A NEW DEBT FREE CURRENCY (FAITH NOTES)**

**DAY THREE: --EXPAND MEDICARE into universal coverage, and nationalize/ convert all hospitals into non-profit orgs.**

**DAY FOUR:  --RESTORE FREEDOM, BY RESTORING THE COMMON LAW LEGAL SYSTEM... Ending the police state.**

**DAY FIVE:   --NATIONALIZE the IRS.**

**DAY SIX:  --RESTORE TRUE PROPERTY RIGHTS.**

**DAY SEVEN: --EXPAND THE E.D.D..  establish zero unemployment in our nation.**

**DAY EIGHT: --NATIONALIZE / REORGANIZE all schools and universities into non-profit orgs.**

**DAY NINE: --EXPAND ALL MARKETS WITH MASSIVE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS.**

**DAY TEN: --END HOMELESSNESS in the USA.**

**---------------------------------**

**DAY ONE :    My first action as President will be to invoke  and use the same powers F.D.R. used in 1933,**

       **(  http://famguardian.org/Subjects/LawAndGovt/Articles/SenateReport93-549.htm   )**    

   **I WILL DECLARE A GENERAL STATE OF EMERGENCY, and use this historical premise to suspend normal government activities and to very quickly enable myself as President to very legally ACT IMMEDIATELY, by executive order to make the immediate changes I will describe in this TEN DAY PLAN.   ALL WILL BE KNOWN BEFORE HAND, AND EVERYONE CAN BE PREPARED FOR THE EXACT CHANGES TO BE MADE AS DESCRIBED HERE.    AND, Congress is always able to reverse any and all of my actions after two years have passed when the state of Emergency must be ended.  BUT THE REALITY IS, if Congress was able to act to do anything of any worth for the restoration of OUR NATION AND CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM, then I would not need to use EMERGENCY WAR POWERS.     A fix must be made, and I will use the same EMERGENCY WAR POWERS, F.D.R. used to get us into this mess.**  

**(And if Congress tries to stop me from doing so, I will turn to and appeal to the people and our armed forces.)**

   **On my first day, I will begin by declaring the 2 year state of emergency, and then put forth executive actions, where by I order the Federal government and all it's agents to implement the following changes effective immediately this day.**

   **PLAN A)  ORDER A CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION TO TAKE PLACE IN TWO YEARS TIME  (BY FORCE IF NEEDED):    All members of congress will hence forth from this day begin preparations for a CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION to occur in two years time at the end of the NEW DECLARED STATE OF EMERGENCY , which per the NATIONAL EMERGENCIES ACT OF 1976, CAN ONLY LAST TWO YEARS.   And so all members of congress will begin to prepare for such a convention to restore our nation to constitutional law, limits and standards, or, I will order the Federal government employees all to immediately begin the following PLAN B, and then PLAN C, and then PLAN D, as needed**

   **PLAN B)  IF NEEDED, due to resistance from CONGRESS to hold a convention, then I will order all members of Congress to be placed under house arrest, being their housing in Washington DC, and order that they all be made to meet 5 days a week, in congress to prepare for said constitutional convention to occur in two years time.**

   **PLAN C) If needed due to resistance from Congress members, all members of congress shall be placed under Federal martial law and literally locked into the halls of congress where they will stay for two years until they carry out the constitutional convention to re-organize our nation back to the constitutional amendment process it abandoned in 1933.**

   **PLAN D) All members of congress who refuse to restore the nation to constitutional standards and take part in the two year process to hammer out the distribution and granting of all Federal powers by Amendment instead of ACTS, shall be considered as agents against the constitution and either barred from the halls of Congress or locked up in prison for breaking their oath of office, WHICH IS TO UPHOLD, DEFEND AND PROTECT THE CONSTITUTION.  If they cannot do that, they belong in jail.**

**DAY TWO :  NATIONALIZE THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK,  and place it directly under the control of the national Treasury Department, and order the TREASURY to begin production of a new FAITH NOTE CERTIFICATE, which will be used to revalue all dollars in circulation immediately this day, and provide currency to flow to all banks from the central Federal Reserve without delays, but with new regulations to take place immediately.  Compensation for the present owners of the Federal Reserve would be considered over the first year of my administration, but to be honest compensation should be small, since they have been robbing our people for decades.  They have had their profits, but some type of payoff would be fair. WITH THIS ORDER, all banks as franchises of the FEDERAL RESERVE would then be required to take a new form, such they operate as a non-profit organization concerning private personal loans to the people for homes and cars MUST BE USURY FREE, but may also act as a for profit organization in all things business or lending to businesses and corporations which borrow to profit.   THIS AND ONLY THIS CAN RESTORE THE SOVEREIGNTY OF OUR GOVERNMENT, to have control of the production of it's own currency and to control it's value within the borders of our own nation.  (This action to be solidified by a CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT stating the sovereign control of the Federal Reserve banking system, and our nations currency production.)**

**DAY THREE :  ORDER the expansion of MEDICARE to cover all legal citizens and NATIONALIZE ALL MAJOR HOSPITALS which are not already operating as non-profit organizations, and mandate their re-organization into non-profit organizations nation wide, each and every one. COMPENSATION for the present private owners of said hospitals to be determined within the first year of nationalization. IT BEING AN OPEN CHALLENGE to any and all investors to attempt to justify why they should be allowed to own hospitals which profit off the sick and dying of our nation??  I CHALLENGE ANY PERSON ON EARTH TO MAKE THAT ARGUMENT.  This action to be solidified by a CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT stating the mandate of Non-profit status for all hospitals with pay scale limits for all administrators of non-profits to be set forth by Congress over time as needed for adjustment compared to minimum wage standards. IT ALSO BEING REQUIRED that a constitutional amendment be put forth to make MEDICARE CONSTITUTIONALLY LEGAL and to mandate universal coverage for all Americans.**

**DAY FOUR :   ORDER THE RESTORATION OF THE COMMON LAW LEGAL SYSTEM our nation enjoyed before 1938, when FDR changed the system from the COMMON LAW, to the modern statute court system.  The immediate result of this being that US citizens are no longer subject to statute rules, and all government agencies are forbidden from making RULE BASED LAW which can be applied to people as human beings, and all presumptions of commercial contract agreement with the FEDERAL GOVERNMENT or any of it's agencies or departments of any kind are hereby made null and void and not applicable to people in court under any circumstances.  Meaning all US citizens are considered free to do as they please, and possess what they please so long as they do no harm or infringe on the freedom and rights of any other free people, and pose no harm or threat to any other free people. THIS ENDS THE DRUG WAR, THIS ENDS THE POLICE STATE, and from this day forward COPS and all police would be mandated to only enforce the COMMON LAW and the basis of this system is NO HARM = NO FOUL, however anyone who causes harm would be subject to REAL PUNISHMENT, hard labor, instead of the soft housing systems used today as light punishment.  THIS ACTION TO BE SOLIDIFIED BY A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT to mandate the COMMON LAW legal system, as the only legal system, protecting the people from all future governments who may wish to restore endless law making and re-create the police state.**

    **IT NEEDS TO BE UNDERSTOOD, the powers of government are limited to regulation of actual business (commerce) and government actions itself, such as all ACTS of Congress can never be applied to the people as laws or rules, and the only way to make law which limits the freedoms of the people is by a constitutional amendment only. THAT WAS THE CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM WE HAD BEFORE 1933, the Common Law, where everyone is free but are expected to behave themselves because THERE IS NO SOFT PRISON SYSTEM, ONLY HARD LABOR CAMPS OR A HANGING.**

**DAY FIVE :  ORDER THE NATIONALIZATION OF THE I.R.S.,  making it all now part of the TREASURY DEPARTMENT, which will then have oversight, which is also under the oversight of the CONGRESS.  The actual tax plan and variations to be used from year to year, decade to decade will of course always be a political issue for debate, however the idea that private for profit organizations should be profiting off a job OUR GOVERNMENT IS SUPPOSED TO BE DOING, is stupidity in itself, and any who would argue that the private sector COLLECTS TAXES better, is likely on the payroll of those who presently own the I.RS.   THIS ACTION to be solidified by a CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT stating the powers to regulate all tax collection under the department of the Treasury which is then regulated directly by CONGRESS, by committee or laws.**

**DAY SIX :   ORDER THE RESTORATION OF TRUE ALLODIAL PROPERTY RIGHTS : by ordering the immediate halt to all practices by any government agency be it State or Federal which has empowered itself to take what is deemed personal property, such as deeded land, vehicles with Title, or any personal items from their citizens without compensation. MEANING city and county government may no longer tow vehicles for profit, or empower for profit private companies to TOW on behalf of any government body. This to include all tax sales or bank sales of property for debts held by any American.  HOWEVER each county and State and FEDERAL body is called to begin a new system where vehicles may be towed for cause, for only for a preset limited charge which cannot rise daily like a  ransom.  IT IS THEFT, to take property and hold it ransom for payment which goes up each day one does not pay.  IF ANY ONE IN THE FREE WORLD DID THIS, they would be called a criminal.  THE DIFFICULTY involved in having to travel distances to retrieve ones vehicle when towed should be punishment enough. And in all circumstance where property is taken for debts, no short sales shall be considered legal from this day, and only fair market sales, where the excess amount, beyond what is owed as a debt must be returned to the property owner who's property was seized to be sold to pay his debts. THIS RESTORES THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONCEPT OF TRUE ALLODIAL TITLE TO LAND AND PROPERTY, which cannot be taken without compensation.   THIS IS BEST SOLIDIFIED by a constitutional amendment stating clearly all peoples ALLODIAL TITLE rights to all their property, with text limiting how and when it can be seized and how it can be sold.**

**DAY SEVEN :   ORDER THE EXPANSION OF THE E.D.D.  EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT to immediately within thirty days to begin offering minimum wage employment to all Americans who are in need of work.  The thirty days given is to allow for Federal Agencies to organize with State and County agencies to begin work programs in each city, and State, some of which will include massive cross state projects of infrastructure or local market expansion and supply improvement projects into energy, resources and otherwise resource management for surface use and protection of valuable surface environments.  MEANING, that after thirty days all Americans will be able to walk into an E.D.D. office and walk out with a job the next day, which may involve training or not, or otherwise will be funded work programs to clean and expand city development and infrastructure which can be considered to have real long term commercial value.  THIS WOULD ESTABLISH ZERO UNEMPLOYMENT nation wide, and offer a unique service to the free market by keeping the poor populations not only working and clean and viable to hire, but also make training and development of the national work force an easy function of government by providing the training programs, through the E.D.D. which also finds them work.**

**DAY EIGHT : ORDER THE NATIONALIZATION OF ALL SCHOOLS AND UNIVERSITIES, other than small institutions, and mandate that they operate as non-profit organizations with income limits for all administrative and executive positions to be regulated by Congress,  as well as mandate that all junior and high schools change their TEACHING METHODS, and adopt a new system which encourages the students to become SELF LEARNERS, who may benefit from teachers but do not need them. The details of this change to the school system can be understood as SELF BRAINWASHING, where we work as individuals to clean not just our bodies but our minds of foolishness, false truths, and lies, and misconceptions which cause us to make errors .  THIS would need to be solidified by a constitutional amendment.**

**DAY NINE :  ORDER THE FORMATION OF MASSIVE MARKET EXPANSION PROGRAMS NATION WIDE,  working with the E.D.D. TO PROVIDE JOBS, beginning but not limited to the following : diversion of some of the Mississippi river into the desert states. The digging of many deep shaft mining projects to not only provide vast deep earth mineral access, but in time allow for the foundation for deep shaft geothermal safe boiler based power systems placed at great depths to boil water to 400 degrees \*f, and provide clean free power to whatever government above which built the deep shaft system mine.  All oceans facing states would begin massive ocean projects, and all farming nation wide will be encouraged to adopt new methods, and provided incentives needed to make carbon sinking and organic farming methods to enrich soils instead of depleting them mandatory because food production is a national resource of the utmost importance, and unless nutrients are put back in the ground, then constant farming depletes land of all farming value and creates worthless land which cannot sustain crops without chemical fertilizers.  WE MUST PREVENT THIS CONSTANT LOSS, AND REVERSE IT, so that our soils can ensure long term production as a national security issue.**

**DAY TEN :   ORDER the immediate formation in every county of every State, highly organized tent camp locations to be regulated by local government funded by the Federal government, where all presently homeless people can immediately find safe tent based housing with police patrols and protection, an address to use for mail, and from this safe location allow  access to welfare and homeless services which are available locally, and otherwise at the end of this first month, all residents in any TENT CAMP LOCATION in any county and any State will be able to walk into an E.D.D. office and have a job the next day locally.  THE JOB not being preset, but if they show up each day they will get paid, and can improve conditions by working to gain work they enjoy or can tolerate.  THIS WILL LITERALLY END HOMELESSNESS IN THE USA within the second week of my administration, and I would push for a constitutional amendment which would make national and mandatory the provision of this basic housing system within each city nation wide, as no American should ever have to live in less than a tent within a government provided tent camp location, designed to honestly help them get back on their feet or as needed find proper housing and life long assisted living services for those who truly need it.  IF NEEDED, I will order the army and national guard to build and set up these camps and if needed regulate and run them on a daily basis.**

   **ALL MY DAYS AFTER THE FIRST 10 DAYS    (MY FIRST TWO YEARS)   : will be spent ensuring that these ten issues are implemented without fail, and that CONGRESS is actually ready to restore our nation to a constitutional process by restoring the Amendment process.**    

   **AFTER THE FIRST TWO YEARS,  Congress would be restored to power and made to hold the constitutional convention which may take another two years to complete, or otherwise will be the focus of my entire four years as President, THE RESTORATION OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW, LIMITS, FREEDOM AND RIGHTS.**  

**I ASK FOR YOUR HELP, or if you run against me, please adopt this plan, set our people free.**

Time to reflect on the horror and loss of life, and later sacrifices that by 2016 led to zero US troops killed in action in Afghanistan, then Donald Trump's mid 2016 election promises that made them targets again, followed by his release of captured terrorists who now violently control their uppermost government, and Biden's politically motivated contribution to the betrayal of peace loving Afghan and US citizens by his honoring the psychopathic deal.

After all the brutality we have seen it's maybe no surprise that Donald will be spending the day making money hosting a Pay Per View fight on TV, after losing everything all the US fought so long and so hard for by running away from Afghanistan after it became (in the words of a soldier who was there all along) ""a cheap insurance policy"" support mission. 

Being allowed to do this says a lot about the enablers who were too cowardly to stop the madness before he had a chance to surrender to the Taliban while the GOP boasted of his ending a war that was in reality killing zero US troops per year.

This year we need to reflect on how far the US has fallen from grace, and all the new victims that are screaming in pain right now because of Donald Trump and his enablers sacrificing them, just to win an election by creating an imaginary battlefield where US troops were imagined being slaughtered. Seeing so many people still falling for the deceptions has given me little hope, in the future of the US, and Afghanistan.

\-Pondered wether disinifectent can be ingested to kill Covid-19 publicly

\-Grabbed Pussy Unabashedly.

\-Suggested we should kill the families of ISIS terrorists and destroy Muslim Holy sites, both War Crimes

\-Mocked a man with a disability in public on tape.

\-Payed off porn stars, and got his lawer fired for it.

\-Committed fraud through a charitable org.

\-Mocked dead US service vets as Suckers and Losers.

\-Edited  an official National Weather Service hurricane prediction map with a  sharpie so that said prediction better reflected POTUS's Tweet.

\-Used Prezzy Powers to defund the mail service to alter the outcome of the future election.

\-Witheld Congressionally approved aid to secure political favor f/ Ukraine

\-Impeachment

\-Said ""good people on both sides""When given opportunity to denounce white nationalism.

\-Said  that the action by police officers who shot an unarmed human being in  the back 7 times or knelt on the neck of a human being until they  suffocated was a little like someone choking at golf.

\-Downplayed a pandemic and killed thousands and thousands of poor souls through negligent homicide.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPSOAz\_9hGk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPSOAz_9hGk)

Watch the malicious radical Right falsely accusing people of ""communism"" and of being ""commie filth"" once again.

""Socialism"" and ""communism"" (by the way, these aren't the same thing) are just euphemism for everything the Greedpublicans and the radical Right don't like, for the government trying to do something about the rampant poverty and homelessness, we know that at this point and the Greedpublicans and radical Right are hypocrites who use social services while accusing people who are poorer than them of ""getting a handout"" or ""not working hard enough"" and they refuse to admit that red states depend heavily on blue states and are more likely to depend on the government:

Late stage capitalism is causing extreme poverty and homelessness and there's definitely a war on the poor and the homeless:

Personally, I agree with the people who believe in a healthy and balanced mix of capitalism and socialism (their positive attributes and benefits, because not all of it is bad). A well balanced mix of capitalism and socialism is the best recipe. One or the other on its own does not work. We need a healthy and balanced mix of the two. Because without that, society falls into one of the two extremes which is late stage capitalism or communism, both of which are pretty fucking bad. And if there was some real and viable third option, I would definitely educate myself about it and consider it.

Greedpublicans and Conservaturds want to practice censorship, persecution and book burning against anyone who so much as consider discussing any option other than late stage capitalism.

Greedpublicans and Conservaturds throw a shit fit whenever someone suggest paying workers what's fair and raising taxes on the rich even by a measly 3%, they also call people who are peaceful protesting ""violent thugs"" and say that protesters who have families to feed and who are asking for a decent salary should be fired:

Greedpublicans and Conservaturds claim that we have a meritocracy in the western world when this proves that no such thing exists and that the system is rigged in favor of the uber rich and against the poor:

The Greedpublicans and Conservaturds are hypocrites who accuse the Left of censorship, repression and cancel culture (only the RADICAL Left does that, most Left-Wing and Center-Left people are against that, but that doesn't stop the radical Right-Wingers for painting all people on the Left and all people leaning Left of being like that and painting them all with a broad brush because they are so hateful and just want to demonize and calumniate the Left all the fucking time), when these radical Right-Wingers themselves, as the hypocrites with double standards that they are, practice censorship, repression and cancel culture against the Left and the Center-Left (that's the pot calling the kettle black), evidence that the radical Right is censoring the Left and that they don't believe in free speech:

I thought the right hated victim/snowflake culture, sjws, regulation, censorship, cancel culture, etc. It seems they change their principles when it's convenient. How telling. That's because they're hypocrites with double standards.

Democratic Socialism is NOT communism and late stage Capitalism IS destroying America:

I've said it before and I'll say it again:

""Democratic Socialists"": Can we have a system like Scandinavia, Australia, and Canada.

Conservatives: Well actually that's not socialism. That's free market capitalism with a functional welfare system and proper state intervention on gaps between the classes.

""Democratic Socialists"": Cool. We know. Can we have free market capitalism with a functional welfare system and proper state intervention on gaps between the classes?

Conservatives: No, that's socialism.

That's how dumb those Conservatives are.

I'm Canadian and I say the U.S.A needs ""Democratic Socialism"" or ""free market capitalism with a functional welfare system and proper state intervention on gaps between the classes."" Whatever you wanna call it.

Also, Socialism already exists in America but only corporations benefit.

In the late stage captalism United-States of America, you now see rampant extreme poverty, endless food lines, and since parents can't provide for themselves and their family & feed their kids on only one job, they have to get two or three jobs and work over 60 hours a week to attempt to make ends meet so the kids are raised by daycare workers and television and don't get to see their parents (and you wonder why kids grow up to be messed up adults; drug addicts, alcoholics, criminals, people with mental health problems, etc).

Watch Mike Figueredo destroy radical Right Tucker Carlson on this:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IouUkaHsqGE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IouUkaHsqGE)

Conservatives turn a blind eye to the ravage and destruction caused by the rotten and failed extreme capitalist system, especially late stage capitalism. They spread the lie that Democratic Socialism is communism but that's a lie and you find out that it is a big lie if you stop listening only to the anti-socialists and start listening to what the other side has to say instead of locking yourself up in an echo chamber and when you see the ravage and destruction caused to the disabled and the poorest of the poor by the late stage capitalism going on in America today. MLK Jr. was maligned when he had his poor people's campaign, and today people are still maligned for doing something for the least of these as Jesus called them.

Conservatives can't accept the fact that a lot of people (especially children and adults who have always been at a disadvantage, who were never given fair and equal opportunity in life, who have been told to pull themselves up by their boot straps, and denied food for being unable to work or denied health care because of ""pre-existing conditions"") are drawn to Democratic Socialism because Capitalism, especially late stage Capitalism, has failed them and only benefit the uber rich and the 1%.

Those Conservatives are against socialism for the poor but they contantly push for socialism for the rich in the form of giant corporate welfare checks and giant tax cut breaks), they're only against socialism for the poor, they're against this only when it's the poor who get something. They don't want the poor to be getting anything. They make false claims like equating Democratic Socialism with Communism, or they spew false accusations of ""Communism"" and ""commie"" every time the government does anything at all to help the least of these as Jesus called them.

They're even against free school lunches for children in poverty, even though those free school lunches help kids to succeeed in school so they can get jobs later in life and work instead of ending up on welfare. Conservatives want to have their cakes and eat it too. They want less people on welfare, but they don't want to give free food/fuel to children in poverty so they can succeed in school and get jobs and climb out of the pit of poverty.

They also complain about the abortion rate, but they're against free/government-funded birth control, so that even the poor and teens/minors who can't afford birth control have access to contraceptives easily and free of charge. If the government has money for wars and bombs, they have money for free school lunches for children in poverty and free contraceptives for all. They say ""How are you going to pay for all that free stuff?"" only when it's free meals and free contraceptives and things that benefit the poor, they never ask that stupid question when it comes to endless wars based on lies or giving the billionaires giant corporate welfare checks and cut breaks.

The poverty rate and abortion rate would decrease when you have free meals and free contraceptive programs in place. They mass distributed free condoms and free pills in a town once and the study said it decreased the abortion rate by 62% just in this one town. Yet Conservatives still aren't fucking happy or satisfied. Conservatives are speaking from both sides of their mouths, they undermine abortion reduction, they want to ban sex education, they don't want poor children to get any food.

The Left is not by any means perfect, but unlike the right they hold their radicals and extremists accountable, they're doing more for the poor and disabled than the Right does, they're against income inequality (and remember that crime thrives due to income inequality), they don't undermine abortion reduction, and they care about the environment/the planet.

Another issue that Democrats need to tackle is child predator perverts on the radical Right who are obsessed with what little girls are wearing and who want to spy on children in the classroom with cameras:

About me:

I always expose the radicals in all parties and hold them accountable (I don't care if they are Conservative, Liberal, Republican, Democrat, I don't care, I can't stand radicals and I expose them and hold them accountable no matter the party) and I'm quite proud of being non-partisan or independent, I don't have a political affiliation and I don't want one. I can't stand radicals no matter the party. I can't stand those bullshit partisanship games, I can't stand partisan hacks and corporate whores either.

I fucking despise radicals in BOTH parties (the Right-Wing FundaMENTALists of the Far-Right and the SJW FemiNAZIS of the Far-Left) and radicalism is cancer on society. I'm one of the countless people who have had it with the hateful, intolerant, bigoted idiots in BOTH parties.

BOTH the Far-Right and the Far-Left are toxic, harmful, destructive and cancer on society. That's why I expose BOTH because BOTH need to be called out on their bullshit, bigotry, insanity, hypocrisy and double standards. I'm Center-Left and Progressive in my values but for the most part I'm NON-PARTISAN OR INDEPENDENT and I'm fed up with the RADICALS/LOONIES in BOTH parties (the Right-Wing FundaMENTALists of the Far-Right and the SJW FemiNAZIS of the Far-Left).

OBAMA CARE: 10,535 pages reduced to 4 sentences.

4 simple sentences

Great summary by a Notre Dame University engineer.........

Here are the 10,535 pages of Obama Care condensed to 4 simple sentences..

As humorous as it sounds.....every last word is absolutely TRUE!

1. In order to insure the uninsured, we first have to un-insure the insured.

2. Next, we require the newly un-insured to be re-insured.

3. To re-insure the newly un-insured, they are required to pay extra charges to be re-insured. (and have diminished coverage)

4. The extra charges are required so that the original insured, who became un-insured, and then became re-insured, can pay enough extra so that the original un- insured can be insured, so it will be ‘free-of-charge’ to them.

spmiw4,jan3d7wh,2022-02-10 17:28:56+00,A plan for action,"My dear democrats, please dont give our nation to the fascists by accomplishing nothing with the power you have been given.  Here are some practical measures that you can still accomplish to avoid that.

1.  The 18-35 demographic is the largest voting bloc in our country and nothing has been accomplished to give them a reason to vote.  Student loan forgiveness is not possible within the current political reality.  No republicans will support it, and 1/2 of the democrats wont either.  Instead of grand gestures with no chance of passage, maybe try working within the framework of what is possible right now.  Retroactively eliminating federal student loan interest is a step in the right direction, and probably has a decent chance of passing too, why no one in the party is at least considering this is fucking incomprehensible to me.  For those who have already paid off student loans under our current highly predatory system, a tax credit could help lessen the blow of missing out on sanity returning to higher education funding. We need to fix this now.
2. The war on drugs needs to end.  This is the least understandable issue to me.  There is not a politician alive who polls higher than weed legalization in either party, why stand in the way of this or play fuck fuck games with it?  whichever party does this first will be rewarded by the voters, and id rather that be us as opposed to the fascists.
3. Fix the fucking roads and bridges.  Build back better was doa when some genius decided to turn a popular infrastructure bill into an unpopular social spending program that was honestly incomprehensible to the average voter.  Stop doing shit like that, if you pass or at least attempt to pass popular, understandable bills the voters will reward you, if you accomplish nothing the voters will punish you, it is really that simple.
4. Prison reform.  We are 5% of the worlds population, yet we have more people behind bars than the next two countries combined, who also represent more than 4 times the population than currently reside in the US.  This has got to stop, and the problem is understandable to the average voter, far more so than ""defund the police"" which I still believe has to have been the work of GOP operatives, because i really want to believe that Democrats are not that fucking stupid.
5. There is alot wrong with what is going on in our country right now, but trying to fix it all at once is a recipe for getting none of it done.  You do not try to eat a four course meal in one bite, why we are attempting to run our politics in that manner is beyond stupid.  Stop doing that.
6. Vaccine mandates are a political loser that are not supported by even a majority within our own party.  They are authoritarian, and right now our federal government does not have the political capital for such measures.  I wish there was enough trust in our government for such measures, but the reality is that there isnt, and there are good reasons why that is the case.  If you casually disregard why this is the case the voters will punish you for your arrogance.  Let's not do that.

I POST THIS... to help my world... as it is my job to do so.

&#x200B;

I have used garlic for 20 years and it never fails, and I have made everyone I know use it, and it has never failed them either.

At first they never want to eat raw fresh garlic, as it is powerful and will make you stink, but once they try it, THEY BELIEVE, and all now will eat garlic at the first signs of illness, and they all recover quickly.

&#x200B;

It is best to chew it with juice, or chopped and mixed in with food.

BUT IT MUST BE RAW, AND FRESH, if it has the little green leaf forming in the core, then it is old and may require 4 to 5 times as much to do the same job.

GARLIC, is an immune system stimulant, which does what nothing else can do.

&#x200B;

OBEY THE CALIPH OF GOD, and recover quickly, or ignore me, and be sick for what could be weeks, and could result in death.

pnn46z,4c6tbp30,2021-09-13 12:59:18+00,Email I received from Rand Paul concerning Fauci funding the Wu Han lab," Email I received from **Rand Paul:**

Anthony Fauci was just exposed in a bombshell report.

And I have sent a criminal referral against him to the Department of Justice.

Remember all the times I took him on in front of the United States Senate?

The media took his side by spewing lies about me and covering up his unethical schemes.

But now the truth has come out. Fauci funded gain-of-function research. And even the media can't ignore it anymore.

I joined Hannity to talk about the report that finally revealed his lies. You can watch it [**HERE**](https://trk.klclick1.com/ls/click?upn=02bixpj5NQJZaKcsmXY64SK14ceXpNBpzlPlHzbpgceEsdjKn-2FF2HgVncZZhShoEWUkkVeoitaHPL1QXBuuF0GPLzEsLzI8wLVpYAfM0QUjwbhH3CreNZ4bazAERe22vtD5__bQNU2F0tDlh5N73s6YHa4A-2Fhz1srBEtovjSCrGfaXTntvyuITQSUuAxcvVgzQTZ-2FT-2BEgnUfc0TWa76XUXPttX0vBCDGVfzRPEWXxq-2F4XpcFQLt638PY6ztXsAoAAdxmkv0wZvugQUR-2Fr-2BAxzcYIKg-2FfOqi3TZ-2BDp5s0cFL9s06z4I2c1MGa2eN9M4DR61QbdJz6p2B51z1aOifFFR2DjCb1VSBgfyKKns4yRmdUmgzEtqfclBz4B2HvwRWi5UyBn7JAgc7fvWD9Y2lUk8oYO3MUnE1o3Gi44-2FiEUSk3nVrr-2By19YsgHM4HqCXBxvs0BSHn72MsLFsmgB92Z5BLy2BqrC-2BGv33pwounlUJsR-2FMfKFkqbIKy8x1-2BMnUVPkE0bAxQg3GEgBi1UXrjRkdOn4TA-3D-3D).

The  Intercept published a report that includes over 900 pages of  jaw-dropping documents that prove Fauci's role in the creation of deadly  viruses.

According  to the report, Fauci's agency, the National Institute of Allergy and  Infectious Diseases, provided grants to the Wuhan lab, including  ""$599,000 that the Wuhan Institute of Virology used in part to identify  and alter bat coronaviruses likely to infect humans.""

Let  me repeat that again: Fauci used your money as a taxpayer to pay a  Chinese lab to ""alter bat coronaviruses likely to infect humans.""

That's bad enough. But here's the worst part: Fauci still thinks he did nothing wrong.

And if he didn't learn his lesson the first time, that means he'd do it again.

*I  must stand up and fight back immediately, or these mad scientists may  well cook up an even worse virus -- one that makes COVID look like  nothing.*

This funding must be cut off forever.

Also included in the $30 billion were funds aimed at crime prevention: community policing, drug treatment and so-called “midnight basketball” leagues to help keep teens out of trouble. Clinton’s efforts to soften the Senate version and include prevention programs won support for the bill from several members of the Congressional Black Caucus. The caucus chairman said at the end of the process, “We have put our stamp on this bill.”The landmark Violence Against Women Act was established in that bill, which has helped reduce domestic violence by two-thirds, a steeper drop than the overall decline in violent crime. And the bill included an assault weapons ban, although congressional Republicans refused to renew it a decade later.But the president also had to appease Republicans to compensate for lost Democratic votes. He maintained the crack and powder cocaine disparity (Clinton pushed for reducing the disparity in his second term but got nowhere with the Republican Congress). And he tied funds for state prison construction to the removal of state judicial discretion on sentencing http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2016/02/22/dont_punish_clinton_sanders_for_1994_crime_bill_129729.html",Democrat,https://www.reddit.com/r/Democrat/comments/4rfg96/the_1994_crime_bill_was_not_strictly_about/,,"{""link"":null,""author"":null}","{""list"":null,""total_awards_count"":0,""total_awards_price"":0}","{""2024-02-02T09:49:59"":0}","{""2024-02-02T09:49:59"":0.5}","{""2024-02-02T09:49:59"":1}",false,false,false,

Members of your own party wanted to nuke the filibuster just 2 years ago for it being ""undemocratic"" but are now willing to pull fire alarms just to delay a vote they don't like.

It's not a Republican government shutdown when the vast majority of no votes are Democrat.

Claiming Republicans ""buy"" voters by promising tax cuts while your own party pushes reparations for votes is hilarious.

If Lauren Boubert is ousted from her position she will most likely just get replaced with a more likable/electable Republican in the primaries.

The party switch was a myth.

If walls don't work why did Democrats put one around the White House?

The subs headline being..

""The Democratic Part is currently the party of old racist prunes!!

Nut jobs who it seems do not really seem to care about reforming the Democratic Party whatsoever, just so long as it continues to go after the Orange Satan.

The city of Denver and the courts seems to be in no rush to evict non-paying tenants until the migrants and came and now there are nearly 13,000 evictions in the courts, because the mayor is planning on giving 3 months of free rent to migrants.

He is begging for FEMA to pay for the migrants who are moving into apartments, that Denver natives were evicted from.

The Mayor of Denver wants FEMA to pay for 3 months of rent on apartments for migrants. 

The Democrat Mayor of Denver migrant programs without FEMA help would total 180 million dollars for next year.

The courts in heavily Democrat Denver have nearly 13,000 evictions that have been served or will be served.

18pnql2,g5exlrsn,2023-12-23 20:47:18+00,Exclusive: New ‘anti-climbing’ concertina wire fencing being added to South Texas border,"BROWNSVILLE, Texas (Border Report) — The Texas National Guard members worked fast Thursday reinforcing fencing with concertina wire along the banks of the Rio Grande here in deep South Texas.

The 12-foot-tall wire fence panels are laced with a 3-foot looping layer of concertina wire that is designed to prevents illegal aliens from trying to climb it and illegally cross from Mexico.

It’s called an anti-climb barrier, and Brownsville is the first Texas border city to get this new fencing as part of Texas’ Operation Lone Star, Texas National Guard Maj. Mike Perry said as he took Border Report on an exclusive first-look tour of the project.

A total of 6,000 feet of anti-climb concertina wire fencing is slated to be built. They’re about halfway through after starting near the Gateway International Bridge four days ago, Texas National Guard Capt. Chris Daniel said.

Daniel leads the team that is building the fencing, as well as spooling concertina wire on the muddy banks of the Rio Grande.

Currently, they are constructing the barrier across from a illegal alien's  camp where about 1,000 undocumented aliens live in Matamoros, Mexico.

The team works quickly and installs about 15 panels per hour. Each panel is 8 feet wide and 12 feet tall and tied together to form a solid barrier.

They do this by laying the fence on the ground and spooling the concertina wire around it. Then it’s put on plastic ballasts “that we’re able to fill with water to instill more stability and rigidity to it – some weight at the bottom so it’s not easy to push over or pull down,” Daniel said.

“What it’s doing is reinforcing the concertina (wire) that’s already there on the bank to try to stop the illegal alien traffic that’s moving through in between these ports of entry here,” he said.

Signs put up in Spanish on the Texas banks warn illegal aliens not to try to cross the concertina wire.

But as far as the eye can see, colorful clothing, blankets and other fabric covers the concertina wire that is on the ground.

Perry says they use the clothing and fabric to climb over the concertina wire that’s on the ground.

He added that many people get injured in the process, and they hope that the concertina wire on the fence will deter illegal aliens from trying to climb over it.

“Nobody is attempting to cross where the barrier is because it adds that extra level of barrier to prevent illegal aliens from coming in and that’s what this mission is: prevention and deterring illegal aliens from coming in,” Perry said.

A quarter mile south of where the crew was working Thursday to install the fencing, a group of about 50 illegal aliens stood trapped in between the concertina wire that’s on the ground and the cold waters of the Rio Grande.

One undocumented Haitian man held a month-old baby and told Border Report in Spanish that they had been there since 2 a.m. and didn’t understand why they couldn’t enter the United States.

National Guard were on the scene watching the group and Border Report was told that U.S. Border Patrol would be notified.

“When they come in contact with migrants they radio to others. We’re strictly here to place the barriers,” Daniel said.

Foreigners who illegally cross in this area are processed at a mobile processing facility on the other side of the levee that’s come to be called Camp Monument.

Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and the Border Patrol’s former chief visited the area on May 5, just days before Title 42 was lifted. At that time, this area was the epicenter for illegal aliens crossings, but the numbers dropped over the summer.
